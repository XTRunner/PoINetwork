Tropical Park,"Jogging Paths & Tracks, Parks",RRaposoMiami,Miami's central large park,"Tropical Park has a bit of everything for anyone looking for nature and sports activities. Have been here over the years for many company and family picnics, for little league baseball and adult softball games in one of the several lighted fields including for soccer. There are ball courts and many rentable shelters and the pine trees and other landscaping. There's a lake and a football stadium as well. Cross Country teams love to train using the little hill near the Miller Road south side. Visited recently to view my son playing a night softball game.",40,June 2019

Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,Ge0rgetravels,"Hard Rock Stadium 347 Don Shula Dr, Miami, FL","Came to this stadium to watch the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco Forty Niners in Super Bowl LIV!  Great stadium and grounds! Security lines moved very quickly during entry into the stadium grounds!  Every seat in the stadium is a good seat offering an obstructed view!  Plenty of choices for food types! Easy to get around even with a large crowd such as the Super Bowl crowd!  To avoid driving in all the traffic, we decided to take an UBER to and from the stadium.  Ubering to the stadium was no problem at all. However, Trying to catch an UBER to leave the stadium was a very different story!!  The stadium has a lot designated for people to get and wait for  Ride shares after the game. After the first wave of Ubers left the stadium, Fresh or returning Ubers could not get into the area.  After a two hour wait, we decided to walk away from the stadium area to a shopping area where there is a Walmart, and try to get an Uber to pick us up there.  We were able to find an UBER to come get us. After another hour wait, he decided he could not get there and cancelled us!  We summoned another UBER, and he said he was coming to pick us up and it would be 18 min.  30 min later, he said he was having trouble getting to us because the police kept blocking off more and more streets causing him to try to find alternate routes. We finally were able to reach an agreement that had us once again hiking away to yet another location where the UBER could get to and we were able to intercept him out in the middle of a very busy street!  We ran thru the traffic to get to and then into his SUV and were finally on our way back to the hotel! Got to our Hotel about 1:45 in the morning!  Bottom line: Stadium great! / Transportation set-up  services following the event: Terrible.  No fault with the UBER drivers, But the stadium needs to come up with a better system to get Ride Shares services accomplished after the games!",40,February 2020

It has a bit of everything and really comes in clutch for those who love to exercise outside and for free! The parking here is free and there are plenty of different spots in the park where you could workout with friends or host a BBQ or a birthday party. My childhood was filled with some dope outdoor birthday parties at Tropical Park. They have the huts you can use with a charcoal grill and picnic tables...just beware of raccoons. There truly so much you can do here and I suggest entering a different way each time, whether through the main entrance on Bird Road or on Miller or any side streets that lead into the park. It will always give you a new perspective.",40,August 2018
Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",PelleasPhiladelphia,Worth the money and the drive,"The hotel concierge tried to talk me out of making this drive (from downtown Miami) saying that it was a long drive and that the Monkey Jungle was small and not worth the trip. I’m very glad that I chose to ignore him! I went to the park with my 4-year old daughter and my parents and we all loved it. The park was the perfect size for all of us to walk around and see everything, and my daughter was beyond thrilled to have such close contact with the monkeys. We didn’t buy the most expensive ticket, but it wasn’t necessary. We felt like we had excellent viewing of all the animals. I highly recommend this unique park. ",50,June 2019

The stadium was one of the best I have ever been to. Plenty of toilets no queues. Loads of food outlets, helpful staff. It is not a cheap day, tickets cost $50 dollars in the ""Gods"" to $500 plus.

Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,Ivy B,Miami Open Tennis,The overall experience was good. Parking was $25 in advance. We got there early so there we got as close as possible to the entrance. The security check point moved pretty quickly. Each person could bring in up to 1 liter of water. I saw people with all kinds of non-alcoholic drinks in their bags. They even let people bring in food which I thought was not prohibited. It actually is a good thing since the food options could use some improvement. Not very many healthy food options. The food and beverages were very expensive. The temporary seating looked to be much more spacious and comfortable than the permanent stadium seats. The only good thing about the permanent 300 level seat is they are protected from the elements. The Grandstand and side course are the way to go during the first weekend and watch the stadium matches on the big screen. You definitely want to be in the 100 or 200 sections.,40,March 2019

We were underwhelmed and were expecting more, since it was so highly rated at both TripAdvisor and in the AAA Tour Book. We missed the property tour, which might have helped us enjoy it more, but to us there wasn't much to see here. The beautiful stone house was only sparsely furnished, and the adjacent cottage can be toured in 15 minutes (we did not wait for the house tour). We did not walk the grounds too far but did enjoy the rocking chairs on the cottage porch. The view to the bay and pier was inviting but was quite far to walk, so we skipped that; our view of the expansive lawn area was marred by large trash cans set up every 50 feet or so (in advance of an upcoming concert, I believe).

Its big and clean and well branded. We were in the upper deck and still had an awesome view of the field so i think its safe to say there isnt a bad seat in that place. The 'party decks' are tickets that are supposed to come with all inclusive beverages. We bought our tickets directly from the Orange Bowl committee, who confirmed this feature, yet when we got there the attendants at the party deck said they weren't honoring the all inclusive packages. That was half the reason we bought those specific tickets! The other reason I took away a point from the 5 star review was the total lack of visual directions posted when leaving the game. We had to rely on ushers the whole way around the stadium asking where we could get an uber. they directed us to a specific parking lot, when we got there the attendants in the lot directed us to an elementary school nearby, when we got there they directed us back to the lot. We walked for almost 40 minutes until we connected with an uber driver that was willing to wait for us to walk and called us to give step by step directions of where we could be picked up.

You can tell the staff loves working here and they care about the animals. Around 4pm is feeding time and we loved watching the tortoises and rhino iguana getting fed a big salad. You should bring quarters to buy sunflower seeds for monkeys who will pull up the chain operated dumb waiter with the seeds to eat. King is the silver backed gorilla who is very picky about his iced-tea and loves Ellen D see YouTube!,50,March 2017
Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",Gavin-Warke,Super,Was such a lovely experience being in with the monkeys! I did get peed on but sure it's all part of being the ones caged!! Had a really good time here! Was such fun interacting with the monkeys feeding them with little raisins and seeing the babies! Worth a visit if out near the place! ,50,March 2017
Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,eileenv525,Lions v. Dolphins,"Nice stadium.  We had access to the bars at ground level that we highly recommend.  One word of caution.  If you do not want to bake in the hot southern Florida sun, buy your seats on the Dolphins side of the field.  ",40,October 2018
Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,JTHOMAS2003,Stadium is very nice and easy to get around in.,If you are going get a parking pass ahead of time and it is simple once you are in to find a spot. The stadium is very nice with plenty of bathrooms and food places. It's not cheap but it's comparable to other stadiums as well. The seats are all good just be ready for the sun! The club level is good and you can usually find someone willing to part with their upgraded tickets to allow you to get up there. ,50,November 2018
Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,SLW1020,Bills at Dolphins game,If you are sensitive to heat be aware that the sun blazes on the visitors side- the stadium provides lightweight sun shields which are definitely helpful. One of my friends on the other side snuck a pic of me melting and using it to cover my head (not its intended use ). ,50,December 2018

Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,SharkPhin,"Great Stadium, but hard to get out","I surprised my wife for our anniversary, after our cruise, with tickets to watch her favorite football team, the Patriots vs the Dolphins.  The game was played at the Hard Rock Stadium.  It is a great venue, but the employees there need more training in location of there amenities.  We were looking for the ""main"" Dolphins store to purchase souvenirs.  The problem with that is we asked several employees how to get to it and were given the wrong location several times and a couple of employees did not know where it was located.  After doing a lap around the stadium and checking some of the smaller team shops, finally we found a younger Male employee who knew how to get to the main store.  After purchasing our souvenirs we proceeded to ""TRY"" and leave the stadium and make our way back to our hotel.  Again we asked employees where to go to catch a ride.  We were informed it is a 20mins walk to the end of the stadium in the ""ride share"" area.  We walked to this area then after talking to other spectators and finally being informed by an employee that we had to walk down the street and make a left turn as only taxis were allowed access to this location.  We started walking with other spectators to this location. After getting to this location and seeing that it was also blocked off by police/security.  Security officer told us we needed to walk farther just past an underpass then cross the street and wait by a school.  So now 1 hour after leaving the stadium and waiting and walking, we arrived at the school and saw at least 50 other people waiting for rides Lyft or Uber. Both companies increased their rates by up to 150%, very nice of them!!!  The first driver we called did not speak English very well, so after calling him several times and not being able to communicate with him, he decided not to show up because he could not find the pick up point.  This happened to several other people.  We had to call for another driver.  It is now dark out and this is not the best/safest area to be waiting.  A couple of guys came up to us and offered to drive us back to our hotel, we politely declined as they were not in a vehicle at the time.  A taxi driver offered to drive us for $100, over 3x times the cost of a Lyft or Uber.  Our driver finally showed up and we made it back to our hotel over 3 hours after the game had ended.  What should have been a fun experience was ruined by employees who need more training, the need for a ""marked"" and ""designated"" area for Lyft/Uber rides and ride share companies not raising prices by 150%.  Will not being going back to this stadium any time soon.  In hindsight, it might have been a better idea to drive to the game and pay the $33 parking fee, at least we would be in a vehicle and not waiting in a seedy neighborhood that is not well lite and hard to find for ride share drivers.  Would have taken pictures to submit, but I was on my phone...",10,December 2018

A couple of things wear a hat the monkeys are walking above you so you came imagine what happens when they have to pee. The monkeys seem very happy and free. They sell raisins to feed the monkeys not sure if you can bring your own but they are the same little boxes you get in the grocery store. I loved May the orangutan she was beautiful and was born there but felt sad for her .And the Gorilla also felt sad for him just wish he could live with other gorillas but I know he can't. I definitely recommend the visit, the staff seemed to really love the monkeys and did great presentations. Go see the Monkeys ",50,April 2017
Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",330jackied,Fun and fast,"This place was so fun and different. It was so cute to feed the little monkeys. You put the food into the cup and the monkey pulls the chain up to get the food. Cutest thing I've ever seen - it never got old! It's a small place and you get through it in an hour so it doesn't take up an entire day. It's a ""must do"" if visiting the area! ",50,April 2017
Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,"Historic Sites, Architectural Buildings",TourGuide-Manager,A symbol of Freedom for Cubans...,"The Freedom Tower, the yellow building that stands out west of the Bayside Market place, was Miami’s first skyscraper built in 1925 as the Miami News where the city’s first newspaper was published.  After Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba in 1959 nearly 300,000 Cuban exiles passed through this building when they fled the island.  It became a symbol of their newfound freedom, a Cuban Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty and is popularly known today as The Freedom Tower.",50,April 2016

The manager assisted us right away, showed the packages, gave no pressure to buy or upgrade our packages and because it was a special occasions, we each also received a special add on to our packages.  I had the 007 package and my husband had the Special Forces Eastern Bloc package. Will was our instructor, he covered with detail all safety matters, proper handling, it was well balanced....not rushed or dragging on. . Will was ex-military, his knowledge and professionalism made us feel secure.  He gave us step by step instructions on how to load and fire and then we proceeded on our own.

What was left was just a fun experience. I went ahead and bought another full auto package, century club, while I was there. This was a great birthday experience and I highly recommend anybody to come stop by and try out the weapons especially the SAW.

Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",lymac7,Feeding monkeys raisins is almost worth the price of admission,"It is so much fun watching these monkeys drop dishes at you from above, asking for food. Put a few raisins in the dish and they eagerly pull the chain up, eat them, drop it back down, and shake it at you if you stop paying attention to them. They can't be fooled, though; put a non-food item in there and they won't touch it. There are some informative exhibits as well, such as King, the gorilla who loves to watch ""Frozen,"" and the feeding in which tons of monkeys come out and go into the water to retrieve hard boiled eggs, etc. Admission is steep, though, and the park is rather far off the beaten path.",40,May 2016

We did the cheapest package, which is still $100+ each, but worth it if you've never done anything like this before. It's a truly unique experience and it all felt very safe. I was a little nervous, but was put at ease by Fabian, who talked us through everything, guided us and was generally super helpful and friendly throughout.

Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",Ileanap_0122,Overpriced attraction,"It is a small jungle where the monkeys are in the wild and the human are caged. There are four shows of only 15 min. Cameroon Gorilla Forest was the best because at least the animal follows directions from trainer. The others, Wild Monkey Swimming Pool (I couldn't see any monkey swimming), Hanging with Orangutans (the animal was sleeping most of the time), an Amazonian Rainforest didn't satisfy my expectations. Also you can see as part of the Wings of Love Foundation, captive parrots that can't be care for the owners anymore, and few iguanas and turtles. For me the best experience was feeding the monkeys with raisins: You put some raisins in a dish with a chain. Then, the monkey pulls up the chain and gets the food. After that, the monkey drops the chain back looking at you smiling and waiting for more food. Very funny. Recommendation: Bring a hat because sometimes the monkeys can pee over your head. The admission is $29.95 for adults, $27.95 for seniors, and $23.95 for children (3-9) plus taxes",30,April 2017

You can feed the monkeys treats and watch them take them out of your hands or small containers.  that was a riot to see!!!,20,April 2017

We didn't see any swimming, but we sat for hours taking pictures and looking at them.  On this visit we saw the Gorilla, but the Orangutan was not available.

Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",CAC53,Great fun place!,"First we enjoyed going through the tunnels and feeding the monkeys in the little dishes on chains.  The monkeys would lower the dishes for you and you would drop (cheap) treats in them and they would pull them up, eat the food and drop it again.  The shows were very informative and fun.  We chose the VIP experience and got to go into the jungle and feed the monkey squirrels and one other type.  The monkey squirrels would climb on your arms and take the food out of your hands.

Definitely walk along the path to the ocean, there was a lot of unique sea life. After enjoying my time with the manatees, I walked a few of the short trails around the estate.

We drove from the Biltmore hotel, and had the effect of ""deja vu"". And not by accident! The fact that ""Biltmore'"" in Coral Gables in 1926 and the ""Freedom tower"" in 1925, was built by one architect - Leopold Schulze. It`s interesting that ""Biltmore"" shifted ""Freedom"" from the pedestal of the tallest building in Florida. In architectural sense, the first turned largely art Deco, and the second in the style of the Spanish Renaissance. Tower ""Freedom"" is inspired by and has direct Parallels with La Giralda in Seville. The building had a difficult history.

It is so modern on the inside and it has a food court with a huge all-glass window looking outside and offered bottles of water and good food that I didn't eat. The stadium seemed to have 5K TVs which were really cool. The best part is the fact that this is right by my house. I live just 10 minutes from the Hard Rock Stadium It may not be in the best location since it is located in Miami Gardens, but was the best sporting experience I've had since I went with the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind to the Marlin's Park in Little Havana back in 2016 to see the Florida Marlins.

This is an average park which has a large football field, a shaded playground and basketball courts in the back. Nothing overly impressive. I did not observe any wildlife in this park, not even a bird. It is however located in an area of Coconut Grove with the most poverty and crime, so this free activity center is a good alternative to the streets for many youths. Knowing the crime level of this area, be aware of your surroundings, and do not leave anything of value in your car, as break ins are common in this area. As tourists don't often visit this area due to the slums and crime, it is one of the few areas of Coconut Grove that thankfully has free parking.

Perrine Wayside Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,Gone to the Dogs,"Perrine Wayside Park is very similar to the nearby Veterans Wayside Park in that it has a crater like lake in the center shaded by trees and is surrounded by limestone cliffs. Parking and admission are free. When I was little, I used to fish at this park and children came to play. Now due to the pressure of a small minority of dog owners, the park has been converted into a dog park and with it many changes. There are now prison-like metal gates enclosing the park, including a separate gated area for smaller dogs. Most disturbing are the following reasons how this park has been destroyed following it's conversion to a dog park: The once clear water is now a thick, algae filled pea soup green. This algae bloom is surely due to the large amount of nitrogenous dog waste making it's way into the lake: from swimming dogs relieving themselves in the water, as well as storm run-off from the grass. The water most likely contains high levels of fecal coliform bacteria as well, and those who let their dogs swim should be cautious, especially around children. This stagnant water is no doubt a breeding ground for mosquitoes as well, which impacts all of the surrounding neighborhoods. I saw what appeared to be a water circulator in the center of the lake but it wasn't making a difference. The aquatic plants which once grew on the shoreline sadly now appear to have been torn to shreds by the dogs. Fishing is no longer allowed as you don't want to hook a dogfish. As you walk the trails you can smell the dog waste in the garbage pails. In the past the park was teeming with wildlife including waterfowl and other birds. Most of them sadly appear to have met their fate from canines or been scared off. Now all I saw was a few brown anole lizards, turtles, and some small mosquito fish (which may have been added to control the mosquito larvae)  When I visited today there were no dogs present, so most visitors are doubtful to even see that much wildlife. Unfortunately many stubborn dog owners still want to convert the nearby Veteran's Wayside Park into a dog park as well. Hopefully the city can learn from what happened to Perrine Wayside Park and won't make the same mistake twice.",20,July 2015
Perrine Wayside Park,Parks,Janin E,Love this dog park,This is a beautiful park to visit with your dogs. I like to keep mine on a leash and simply walk them around the area. It is quite scenic and pretty. I would never let me dog in the water though. ,50,November 2015

We were told to go to isle entry 129-130 to get onto the field. After getting over there we waited in line with about four hundred other people that were also trying to get to their field seats. As it turned out, there were no wristbands there and the Buffett part of the concert had already been underway for ten minutes. We were told that we would have to go back down to the entrance and there we would find someone giving out the wristbands. We did this and had to stand in a single line about a hundred feet long where two people at a table were working feverishly to check tickets and strap on wristbands! Once we stood in that line for fifteen minutes we had to return to isle entry 129/130 and wait there for another twenty minutes before we could get on the field and to our seats. It was eight o’clock before we were seated in our seats and Buffett had already played for an hour which meant that we only got to enjoy the Buffett part of the show for thirty minutes.

Though it does make the landscape more interesting, parents do however have to keep a closer eye on their kids, as they can easily crack their heads open on these massive rocks, or break a bone if they fall/slip while rock climbing. There is a walking path which is shaded by beautiful palm trees. There is a playground, but no bathroom facilities. Parking and entrance is free.",40,December 2014

Haitian Heritage Museum,"History Museums, Art Museums",jadorae,The passion for Haitian culture is evident.,"I had an excellent time at the Haitian Heritage Museum! Upon arrival, I was greeted by one of the founders of the museum, Serge. He was very friendly and welcoming. He educated me on the history of the museum, and why it was created. In doing so, he also gave me a brief history of Haitians in Miami, Little Haiti, and, the country of Haiti itself. The passion Serge and his team have for Haiti, Haitians, and Haitian culture is highly evident in their carefully curated pieces on display. Their current physical location is temporary until they are able to build a permanent site. With that in mind, the pieces on display can be viewed as a ""sneak peek"" of what is to come once they move to their permanent site. I would highly recommend a visit here for anyone who likes art, history, Haitian culture, or looking for an experience off the beaten path.",50,December 2016

The music, the art, the general ambiance, was electric!  The staff was courteous and eager to answer questions about the exhibit.

Instead of paintings, there was a fabulous exhibit of photography by Marc Baptiste. It was also good fortune that the curator of the museum Evelyn was there to take us from photograph to photograph. She was so passionate, informative, and inspiring that I knew right then and there I was in the right place at the right time. As a special bonus, the discussion of art extrapolated into a discussion that was art unto itself. ",40,January 2019
Haitian Heritage Museum,"History Museums, Art Museums",Melby7,Very disappointing,"Haiti surely has a rich heritage in art and (even more so) handicraft. However, you don't find any of that here. This is a museum without artifacts. The exhibits are just some walls posted with texts and pictures about Haitian history. A bit like pages torn out of history textbook meant for elementary school . You would probably get more out of reading about Haiti on Wikipedia. A meaningless kind of museum, a waste of money that could be spent much better, whether on Haiti or in the Haitian communities in the US. Sadly, an example of Haiti at it's worst. The (nice and friendly) staff seemed to well appreciate the nonsense of this museum: Nobody turned up until ½ hour after official opening hours.",10,September 2019

Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,Erika C,Great Venue with Excellent Staff and Support!!,"I just had the sublime pleasure of seeing The Rolling Stones at this venue. Entry was easy and things were reasonably well-marked but the excellent event staff made it a breeze to get our wristbands and get to our seats. The sound quality was excellent, likely due to the production staff of The Stones and our excellent seats (section D, floor), but I’ve been to plenty of other shows and had similar seats and the sound quality was crap. I’m giving the venue four stars because 1) I’m still elated from the show and 2) the event staff really was stellar. The one thing that wasn’t: the post-show transportation arrangements. We had to walk nearly five miles, mostly in a circle, for over two hours to get an Uber back to our hotel. It’s not necessarily the venue’s fault for that but the event planners really could have made more robust arrangements to handle the sheer amount of people who needed transportation home. Both my mum and I currently are dealing with mobility issues and absolutely no one from the staff was able to/did offer any assistance. I’ll definitely go to more shows there but now I know to pre-plan all transportation.",40,August 2019

Bayfront Holiday Village,Cultural Events,Dallende,Christmas Village a la Miami!,"The holiday village at Bayfront Park is full of wonderful gems. I was able to check off my Christmas list, while browsing the cute stores that displayed everything from hand-made purses made of wood, toys, jewelry and pashminas. I was amazed at the caliber of items available in the village. Vendors from Portugal, Italy, Turkey and even Bethlehem displayed their products, and I made a serious dent in my wallet, but I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping. I also loved the food. I ate a delicious lobster roll, and because I RSVP'd online at bayfrontholidayvillage.com, I got a free Christmas Makers Shaker at the Makers Mark Bar! Speaking of bars, they have the North Pole Beach Club, which is a great place to sit back and watch the boats go by while sipping a Peppermint Mojito. I had quite a few of those, while my nieces rented rollerskates at Bayskate to skate around the 50 ft. Christmas Tree. That tree is unlike any I've seen in Miami. It's animated, and several times a night, they lower the lights and rev up the music and put on an LED Christmas tree show. It's amazing. I also enjoyed nibbling on caramel apples at Ricky's Arepas and by the end of the night, we bought some hot chocolate and churros to people watch. This is a wonderful place to get into the spirit and enjoy Miami weather. It runs all the way through Christmas day, so we plan to be back again and again.",50,December 2019

Once your server has explained the basics you can go over to a wall of replica guns that you can handle to help you pick your weapons. We arrived early in the day, and we had a short wait of 20-30 minutes. While you are waiting they have a small but interesting game collection of firearms in cases with historical data about them.

For the holidays, various sponsors like Pottery Barn decorated the place to showcase their merchandise. While the decorations worked and matched the house, a lot of the displays felt like extended ads for the sponsors.

The structures of animals and sea-life are exquisite, the work effort is jaw-dropping and the lighting display is inspiring, to say the least.  This exhibit ranks with a Chihully glass show.  We went last Wednesday and purchased discount tickets on Goldstar.  U can watch an acrobat show as well, i thought it was so-so.  I'm writing this review because i read other reviews that were overwhelmingly positive but one that said the exhibit was terrible because the writer saw ""mice"" at an outdoor tropical exhibit with numerous caged animals, ie birds, etc. How silly, what else would u expect to find there?

FIU Nature Preserve,Nature & Wildlife Areas,MrMiamiExplorer,A Hidden Gem,"Though this nature preserve has been open to the public for decades, most in Dade County are unaware of it's existence. Surrounded by development like an island of foliage, this preserve contains a number of natural habitats: Pine Rocklands, Tropical Hardwood Hammocks, and Freshwater Wetlands. I was expecting to be through the whole preserve in a matter of minutes, but 30 minutes later I was still hiking the shaded trails. Just when you think you've reached the end, the trails continue to more habitats. It is hard to believe that you are surrounded by civilization, as just a few feet into the preserve, you can almost imagine being deep in the Florida Everglades. In addition to the trails, there is a lake on the West side which has a plentiful population of aquatic plants on it's shoreline including pond apples and cattails. I saw a variety of wildlife while exploring the preserve for less than an hour including: gray squirrel, brown & bark anole lizards, anhinga, spiny box spider, mockingbird, skipper butterfly, bull ant, and mosquito fish. Though admission is free and open to the public, nearby parking is at paid meters. I will definitely keep returning.",50,August 2015

When I went to the counter and asked her why, she spoke Spanish and got the manager. The manager said too many kids break things. I explained there was no sign saying not to touch it, he wasn't a child and how do they expect to sell the product? The 3 employees proceeded to speak Spanish amongst themselves and curtly said he could try it for a second but that's it. I replied that we really were no longer interested.

Palmetto Bay Park,Playgrounds,MrMiamiExplorer,One of the Largest,"Palmetto Bay Park is one of the largest areas of green space in all of the City of Palmetto Bay. It is conveniently located just off US1 and is within walking distance of many neighborhoods. Visiting on a late Monday afternoon there were plenty of people of all ages and races enjoying the park. There are biking/jogging trails, outdoor exercise equipment, soccer, football & baseball fields, a playground, and wide areas of grass and trees. The baseball fields have netting over the bleachers to protect spectators from home run balls. The wildlife I observed over the 1 hour I was present at the park consisted of mostly birds and included: white ibis, mocking birds, blue jays, grackles, and others. The East side of the park was well maintained and had green freshly mowed grass. Unfortunately the far West side of the park does not appear to be routinely maintained as it had a lot of lumpy, sick looking brown grass filled with weeds and trash especially in the Southwest corner. The grass was also long in this West side area and the middle of the field was used as a dumping ground for old metal soccer goals, many of which were lying in rusty heaps on the ground. Besides these eyesores the only other aspect of the park which wasn't cheery, was the Miami Children's Hospital Outpatient Center built on the Northwest side of the park. The park's bike path even goes right up to the hospital's back door. On the positive side, at least the kids inside the hospital can look out the windows to see a park, and maybe play games in the park before or after a medical appointment. There are beautiful shady Poinciana trees lining the jogging trail, perfect for picnicking under. There was also a variety of other flowering and even fruiting plants (mangoes, coco plums) Parking and admission are free.This was my first visit, and I will keep returning.",40,July 2015

The Vineyard is large and offers four services at the weekend (on both Saturdays and Sundays) as well as social events, coffee before and after the service, lots of activities and is especially good for families.   The music is loud and vibrant, with lots of singers and musicians on the stage;  the pastor's sermon had multiple points and I would say has the kind of content that you can apply to your life right away, however, I would not say that it was theologically deep so it's a perfect place for seekers, new believers and younger families although there was a smattering of people over 55 in the congregation the night we went.

The parrot on my arm turned its head just as the picture was shot. I said something to the lady, and she brushed me away and said it was fine. I asked her to look, and she said it was fine. Sure enough when we went to pick up our picture, the parrot on my arm had it's head turned to the back. I bought the picture anyway, but was definitely annoyed. Was a great visit, but to be honest, not worth paying full price. We got discounted tickets, and enjoyed ourselves very much. However, I think it's a one time visit place :)",50,November 2019

Someone did answer the phone when I called and said I could park on the outside and walk in, also someone came to unlock it about 15 minutes later and I was able to park inside. There was nothing wrong with the restrooms and though no naturalist or volunteer was on site, I did get the trail guide and the trail is easy enough to follow if you navigate carefully over the roots and coral rock. This is a well known park among bird and butterfly watchers so happy that birds and butterflys have some natural habitat in the area. I recommend combining a trip there with other nearby sites if you are interested in the South Florida ecosystem.",40,April 2016
Castellow Hammock Preserve and Nature Center,Nature & Wildlife Areas,MrMiamiExplorer,Hidden Natural Florida,"I had not visited this preserve in a long time, and was eager to see if it has changed. Parking and admission were free. At the front entrance there are fields for recreation as well as a butterfly garden, and a small 1 room nature center. From the outside you may expect that the nature trail is short, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was still hiking an hour later. Be very careful not to get lost while hiking and always keep an eye out for the orange paint markings on the trees to help navigate your way out as the main trail sometimes disappears and other non-marked trails split off. I followed the paint markings on the trees and still ended up going in a circle at one point before I noticed familiar surroundings. Hiking boots are best as much of the trail is touch terrain of tree roots and jagged rock. There are is also a deep solution hole that you don't want to fall into. It is amazing to think that this escape from civilization is surrounded on all sides by farms and plant nurseries. As I walked through the ancient forest I could almost imagine encountering Native Americans or the Blair Witch. We observed a lot of wildlife during the 1 hour hiking the preserve including: zebra longwing and sulfur butterflies, mockingbirds, mourning doves, grackles, red bellied woodpecker, brown & bark anole lizards, gray squirrel, cottontail rabbit, golden silk spiders, pearl spiders, tree snails, ground snails, and unfortunately lots of mosquitoes.

The Buff-bellied and Rufous Hummingbirds were super, but our greatest memory of the visit was the amazing staff.  A young woman named Laura who works at at the park, came out when she noticed that we were in the butterfly garden.  She displayed an understanding of the special avian visitors in her park that I have never seen anywhere in the world.  She knew the personalities of the birds, their habits, exact movements, and precise locations.

The hike is not very long, but it is mighty interesting - full of curves and green limestone, which makes it quite the exotic little treat. The hike will take about 20 or so minutes - please wear proper hiking shoes and enough mosquito repellent. Since there are many curves and limestone rock, you must be careful to note where you step. There are some frogs/toads hopping away, so watch that you do not step on them! In one area, there is even a sinkhole enveloped by an enormous tree. Very spooky and picturesque. I would definitely go back to this little gem. The vegetation/forestry reminded me of being back home in CT, which was a very nice reminder. Go hike!",50,June 2017

I am the last person to have décor define my experience, but this is crazy for a city like Miami. It looks like in the 1950's or 60's they built the airport and didn't do anything since. I know Miami has a huge Cuban influence, but the airport doesn't need to look like what I would expect to see in Havana. They need to modernize everything! Also there was garbage on the floor everywhere, and this was BEFORE the Covid-19 started and they needed to cut back their workforce. While stuck out of the country we heard from people who got back before us and they talked about how dirty the Miami airport was. I can only imagine how bad it has gotten with less cleaning crew available. Miami, get into the 21 Century and show a great first impression that I would expect from you.

There is a focus on local and Latin artists - mainly contemporary - which I've found very interesting.  In fact their current exhibition ""Transcultural Pilgrim: Three Decades of Work by José Bedia"" was excellent.  Sure, you won't see Picasso and Monet here, but if you're at all interested in Miami's local and Latin art scene I recommend a visit.  It's quite easy to get to even if the area is a bit sketchy.  It's near the municipal courts and police headquarters.  Street parking is easy.

The first floor is very impressive with its painting but the second floor I was not as interesting. The second floor is mostly filled with artifacts from Miami. Cool but not very impressive.

Don't assume that because Miami is a big city that the art museum is a cultural asset. In fact, the place is as small as the art museums in the small cities in West Texas where I am from. Moreover, the museum is 1) in a dodgy part of town, at least on a Saturday; and 2) has an indifferent, even hostile staff. (Apparently they are unaccustomed to people disturbing them by actually wanting to see some art). Ugh. It took me about 15 minutes to see the whole thing last June. Dont waste your time.",10,

Regardless of the number of visits, there is always a comprehensive safety procedure and you can shoot in confidence and security. The instructors are the best in the world, I had Brian. The instructors instill confidence and if you have never shot previously, feel confident here! State of the art hearing protection, and, if you want a gopro card can record your experience. Our 14 year old grandson who visited with me was well made up! Now the envy of all his classmates. The museum, although compact is very interesting.

Most of the Brigade returned to this area which became known as Little Havana. This was a pivotal moment in history, as after the failed invasion, the Cuban Government embraced the Soviet regime, and this led to the ""Cuban Missile crisis"" the following year which was one of the highest points of the cold war. A short walk south of this monument , is a sculpture of Nestor Izquierdo, who was a senior figure in the brigade.

Continental Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,The Way a Neighborhood Park Should Be,"I had not been to Continental Park in many years and was interested to see how it's changed. In my opinion Continental park is everything a neighborhood park should be. Parking and admission is free. You won't find anyone in a guard booth demanding cash for admittance. There is plenty of open green space for recreational activities which is not enclosed by fences so neighborhood kids can just go and come as they please from the houses that surround the park. There is a soccer field, baseball fields, tennis center and courts, community center, playground, and walking paths. The walking path on the East side of the park by the tennis center goes through areas of preserved pine rockland and other native plants, where you can observe wildlife if you are lucky and quiet enough. In this area you can also observe the historical ""Dice House"" which is the oldest area building, having stood since the 1920's. If only all Dade and Broward County parks could follow Continental Park's example.",50,December 2014

Pretty easy getting through security and beers being sold for 11 dollars each. Expensive! Food also over priced but good portions and quite tasty. Game was good although hard to hear the commentary at times. I've marked this down badly as after the match it was really disorganised. We got told different things by several different people about where to get uber's and taxis from so were walking around for ages. Found a taxi sign and got into the queue but there was no shade and it was 40 degrees. We saw three people keel over. We queued for about half hour then a police woman came and said no taxis would come there so we were fuming. We had to walk for half hour in the baking sun to Walmart where we just happened to stumble across a taxi and jumpped in it but there were loads of other people still waiting so God knows how they got home. It was a real shambles. The need to sort it out, put up proper signage and have a taxi or uber system.  ",20,September 2019

We were able to tour the pier area and meet the resident manages but not much more outside. The thing that was different than other stately homes was we were all alone in the house. We bought the tickets at the beginning of a walking path then were on our own for several hours.  Several rooms were near empty, with a few fully furnished rooms having minimal explanation. We enjoyed the movie in the “cottage” and were grateful for the additional context. We left just as a free tour started, and I would recommend time your visit with that in mind.

Many old growth gardens with majestic oaks,banyans and other tropical trees give the area an almost jungle appearance. There's a village center with many shops and some fine restaurants as well. And all this can be explored by using the excellent bike path that extends through the neighborhood and down the shaded scenic roadway known as Old Cutler Road. One nice option would be to cycle down the path all the way to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens,take a picnic lunch and enjoy it at Matheson Hammock Park next to Fairchild, this would make for a fine day especially during one of our cooler months of the year.",40,October 2014

Hard Rock Stadium,Arenas & Stadiums,Kate F,Ride sharing difficulties = many drunk drivers,"Although the stadium is quite modern and full of amenities, the management of Hard Rock Stadium did a huge disservice to it’s patrons by making ride-sharing services a pain in the neck (or rather feet) to partake in. To take an Uber or Lyft, one must walk blocks to a local elementary school. In the meantime, the taxis are located at the SE gate and attempt to cheat passengers with “flat fares”, cash only, and unwillingness to use their meters.

From the beauty of it when you first see it appear in the distance to the amenities when you're cheering your team on it's hard to beat. Easily the best food and drink options out of any stadium (though very expensive) and the covered seating is clutch in the brutal South Florida heat. 4 giant big screens around the stadium make missing the action darn near impossible. With new walkways, bridges and tunnels for fans its safer than ever and plenty of merchandise and interactive zones make this the best game day experience.",50,October 2019

We started by feeding them with the chained bowls, but the highlight was having them sit and walk on us while we fed them. They seem to have a lot of freedom and the staff seemed to know them individually. We watched the gorilla show with King and found it interesting. King’s trainer seemed to genuinely care for him and stated he only does what he wants. He must be happy/content there, because he was very cooperative with her. It was a fun/informative afternoon.

Baby lemurs love people and just don’t leave you alone.  They were very happy to play with our hair, try to steal our glasses, and bounce from one family member to the next.  The rest of the place had many wonderful animals like birds that enjoyed the staff and were happy to climb on the visitors.  We also got to interact with a joey.

Chapman Field Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,In a Sad State,"I had not been to this park since I was little, so I was interested to see how it was changed. The park is located in a nice area surrounded by rich communities, but strangely, a garbage dump/waste transfer station is just steps from the park entrance.  Unfortunately I was shocked by what it has become. Both of the baseball fields were fenced off stating that it was temporarily closed for soil testing. I suppose like a few other parks in the Miami area they found heavy levels of toxins. The fields were so overgrown and untended due to the ""temporary"" closure they reminded me of baseball fields you might see on the Walking Dead. There is an unpaved trail you can drive, bike, or hike with leads through a mangrove forest down to the bay. Unfortunately the trail was so bumpy and muddy that I turned back after a few minutes. I didn't want to destroy my vehicle or ruin the alignment, as it was bouncing around as I drove. To make matters worse, the sides of my car got coated in mud, and I think I picked up a nail in my tire on that trail. If it wasn't so blazing hot and exposed, I might have hiked it instead.",20,June 2015

I did not know much about this but was so pleased it was a fantastic performance with very strong voices and the lead Norma played by Mary Elizabeth Williams was incredible. Her range and strength and stamina was unforgettable. The nice part about this was before the opera  we are given an overview of it, if you arrive early at 7 and then after the performance we are invited to stay and talk with some of the actors. It found it so exciting and enlightening. Norma was quick moving, a love triangle tragedy, but very well done by all. Can't wait to see other operas as well. The conductor Anthony Barrese, was very passionate and made the music soar...an added plus. A wonderful night out!",50,January 2016

The staff  is extremely knowledgeable and willing to spend their time describing each item.  They not only offer their products but also well known brews from well known microbreweries around the nation.  The owners are in house and readily available for further discussion and are willing to give tours and instruction on the process leading to their magnificent products.  I am not a beer drinker by habit, the extent of my consumption was mainly Guinness; but.... I am happy to say  I have two new loves, The Gunfighter Blonde and the Spitfire Redhead.  Magnificent!!!

The beer was really good and they make one heck of a grilled cheese sandwich too. The menu is limited but if you like ""comfort food"" there are some selections you might enjoy.  I recommend the smashed avocado with chips  for an appetizer to share.  Portions are good and everything was really tasty.

Effusion Gallery,Art Galleries,Gu1otta,Nah,"To be honest, I loved this store. This is our third year coming to Miami for summer vacation. Every year I go to Effusion to buy something or at least see what's new. Tonight was very unsettling. My wife & I walked in to look around, literally the first store we have walked into since we got here. I noticed the older lady working seemed to be following me. I didn't pay it any mind. Suddenly, she disappears & peeks around the corner at me! There are plenty of people in the store at the time but for some reason she's targeting me. Mind you, I am wearing a short sleeve shirt & gym shorts. I don't know what she thought I was going to steal. At this point, I'm pretty offended & feel very indignified. I came there to buy my 2 sons something for their bedrooms, not this. I find my wife & tell her I'm ready to go. As I'm passing by the counter, I see the lady on her laptop looking at past surveillance footage. I didn't touch a single thing the whole time I was there.

Florida Grand Opera,Operas,S6usanne,Excellent regional opera,"We attend one or two of the Florida Grand Opera performances every year, driving up from our home near Key West and staying over for the night in Miami.  We have seen excellent productions (among others) of Madame Butterfly, Turandot, and most recently a lovely Traviata.  The costumes and staging are grand and well done, the singers near the top of international quality.  It is not the Met, but the quality compares favorably with, say, the Santa Fe opera, and if the Arsht Center doesn't have the Met's grand chandeliers or Santa Fe's mountain view, it is nonetheless a very lovely opera house with good acoustics.  The educational talks offered an hour before curtain time are always interesting.  A lovely experience. ",50,April 2013

Apparently they also have fish dip and chips but we didn't order any.   Flights of 4 are $12 and each pint we had was $7   It wasn't very busy when we were there but I am sure it is pre and post games.   Parking in garage next door is free for first hour, $1 per hour after.   Has about a dozen seats at the bar and some low tables.   Our server, Nico was very friendly and knowledgeable.

Miami-Dade Main Library,Libraries,Annalisad65,Libraries in Miami - Lots to Love!,"I am a huge fan of Miami-Dade Public Library System. I belong to two book clubs and most of the books I read are from the library. MDPLS has an excellent selection of books, including recent releases in all its libraries. Ordering a book is easy and the wait is usually short. My local library is Lemon City where the staff are always 100%. Friendly, helpful and eternally in good form. It’s a pleasure to go there, conveniently located two blocks west of Biscayne Blvd., with ample parking on the streets if the lot is full. I’ve taken free Spanish lessons at the Westchester library and have enjoyed workshops and music performances at several libraries throughout the city and Miami Beach over the years. I go to the Main Library from time to time, usually to see an art exhibit-there’s a fine space upstairs that showcases beautifully. Recently I attended a GMD workshop and this past Saturday, the Local Author Fair. It was a wonderful event and I had the opportunity to meet several local authors including Seth Bramson, Craig Pittman, Maika Moulite, Maritza Moulite, Tamara B. Rodriguez and more. South Florida has a treasure trove of talented writers. The event included live music performances and started on time with remarks from Ray Baker, Director at Miami-Dade Public Library System who thanked everyone for attending, encouraged all to get library cards and thoughtfully acknowledged the staff who worked tirelessly to pull this event together. Keynote speakers were Craig Pittman and Edwidge Danticat and both did entertaining, and in the case of Ms. Danticat, heartwarming PowerPoint presentations. Books & Books was on hand selling local authors’ books. I picked up several and wished I got more! The Main Library is located on the plaza level of the Miami-Dade Cultural Center along with HistoryMiami Museum on West Flagler Street. (The Cultural Center is a striking, fortress-like complex, designed by Philip Johnson, in the early 1980s in the heart of historic downtown Miami steps from the Metromover). Highly recommended getting a library card and spending a couple hours in this lovely library or indeed any branch around the city and county.",50,September 2019
Chapman Field Park,Parks,183glennb,"Great location, badly needs some TLC!","It looks like at one point the county was putting some money into developing this park but that stopped long ago and most of the park is closed ""temporarily"".  Another visitor posted a similar experience a year ago.  There is a canoe and kayak launch (no motorized boats are allowed)  but the mangrove trail leading to the bay has become almost impassable. Is a machete not in the county's budget?  This place should be filled with visitors but sadly it was all but deserted the day I visited.",10,June 2016
Chapman Field Park,Parks,Jason A,Kayaking ,"This place is very nice for kayaking or canoeing. When you pass the ball fields go down the dirt road and you will get to the launch, which is nice. You have two trails. One goes East to the pond, I perfer going to the west which will take you to though a trail that goes under a bridge  which will go to a big Lake with a mangrove island in the middle which is beautiful nice and, open and peaceful nice fishing too. Then keep to the right there is another trail which has an amazing  scenery,the wild life is awsome. Saw lots of pretty, and exotic birds. Different types of lizards, lots of fish . Then it will open to the bay where you can fish for hour or snorkel. It is a must do if you like nature. ",50,July 2016

Kendall Indian Hammocks Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,Beautiful and Scary Park,"I had last visited Kendall Indian Hammocks Park when I was little and was interested in visiting the next time I was in the area to see how it's changed. I was finally passing by this August of 2014 on the way home from an appointment. Entrance to this large park is free. The playground is shaded by beautiful oak trees and there is lots of space for recreation. The nature trail located at the center of the park runs through a beautiful lush forest with foliage so dense it reminded me of South American Rainforests. Unfortunately most of the vines are of non-native exotics. I observed squirrels, birds, and butterflies on the trail. The playground and picnic areas on the North East side of the park are well maintained. I would however suggest avoiding the West and South West sides of the park as they are VERY CREEPY! To elaborate: a grassy area on the West side of the park is used as a potters field by the Miami Dade County Medical Examiners Office to dispose of and bury unclaimed bodies. Public records have stated that at least 900 people are buried there in unmarked graves. The South side of the park has land that appears to have previously been part of the public park in the past, but apparently is now rented or sold to other organizations. I assume it is therefore no longer maintained by Miami Dade County Parks and Recreation. All of the picnic shelters in this area of the park have roofs that are caving in, some have been set on fire and are barely standing, and some have collapsed into piles of rubble and rotted wood. It reminded me of a playground from a post apocalyptic movie. I'm shocked that these dangerous old picnic shelters have not been removed by the County, regardless of whether it is their responsibility to maintain them. It also appears that nearby on the South side of the park, a section of land is used as a junkyard, repo, or tow yard for cars. I would suggest that all visitors enter and exit through the East side of the park to avoid these eyesores and creepy surroundings.",40,August 2014
Westwind Lakes Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,Nice Community Park,"I had heard of this park many times, but this was my first visit. There are lots of open green spaces / fields for recreational activities, including soccer, baseball and football.There is also a jogging trail. The wildlife I saw consisted of butterflies, brown anole lizards, dragonflies, muscovy ducks (which patiently waited in the picnic area hoping for a handout), and a few other birds. There is also a skateboard ramp park, and a community center (which has a pretty Everglades mural painting at the entrance) Parking and admission are free. Despite the name, the park is not on a lake, but does border a canal. Unfortunately for safety reasons it is fenced off, so fishing is not a possibility. The only other negative was that there were 3 park staff members (a shady looking woman and 2 others wearing park staff shirts) constantly joyriding around the park in a golf cart, acting unprofessional while guests had to get out of their path. The park must be way overstaffed if those three were apparently circling the park (with nothing else to do) for over an hour, trying to kill time and get paid additional hours and/or overtime. I can understand 1 staff member on a golf cart patrolling, but THREE? Overall I was still impressed with the park and will return.",40,September 2015

Many of the performances were superb productions with near top level performers, but the temperamental Miami audience does not seem to appreciate some of the more adventurous productions. The retirement of the tireless long time master, will undoubtedly make significant changes....time will tell how.  The controversially named ""Opera House"" is a remarkably unremarkable incredibly costly building with shoddy finishes and materials, the overpowering garish curtain and cheap lighting may be appreciated by ""Music Hall"" or burlesque audiences.Unfortunately the building and its gauche name detract from being a ""GRAND OPERA""    ",30,December 2011

Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,Gardens,MrMiamiExplorer,Small Attraction but Free,"The Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden is located on Watson Island, nearby Jungle Island, The Miami Children's Museum, and the Miami Yacht Club. Admission to this attraction is free, but there is no free parking. Your only parking options if taking your own transportation are to pay to park in the nearby parking garage, or feed the nearby meters across the street. The foliage is not very lush and most appeared to be unhealthy and not maintained. Also the fish pond was so poorly neglected that the water was green and thick as pea soup with algae. The fish were barely visible and probably starved for oxygen swimming in that slimy, algae soup. Based on the frenzy they made in the water when I approached, they were very hungry as well. The Garden is surrounded on all 4 sides by concrete walls, and it is a nice place to relax as it is so empty, but unfortunately the sound of cars whizzing by just feet away on the MacArthur Causeway kind of ruins the tranquility. I would not suggest making a separate drive just to visit this place, but if you have already traveled to or paid to visit one of the other businesses on the Island: such as Jungle Island or the Miami Children's Museum, than you may want to walk over to judge for yourself. A few times a year there are cultural events held at the garden.That is when I suggest going.",30,January 2015
Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,Gardens,SeleneBenita,Nothing to see,"Very disappointing. The worst Japanese garden I've ever visited.

Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,Gardens,ARodriguezP,Should be better maintained! ,"Like others have mentioned it is in fact tiny compared to other Japanese gardens such as the one in the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens or dare I say the one in Portland, Oregon(Portland's is probably one of the most authentic outside of Japan so any comparison is actually unfair!) but the number one issue here is the lack of maintenance. It's a shame with the ideal location and surrounding views that this garden is in such a state. I live on the mainland and habitually take the MacArthur causeway to work or play on Miami Beach and every so often I'll stop there to check on the garden's progress and it never seems to shine,it's like a neglected houseplant that just withers away without ever getting enough care and attention to thrive! Shame on the city of Miami for not giving this potentially nice garden the attention it sorely requires! The city needs to rework this garden,possibly making it larger (maybe relocating it if need be) and then hiring a dedicated staff to maintain it. Yes it's free and though adjacent parking isn't one could visit the garden while visiting next doors Jungle Island or the Miami Children's Museum across the causeway. I do hope the city Parks and Recreation department (maybe   with the help of the local Japanese consulate,just a thought) create a project to make this garden shine! And being an avid gardener myself if a project were announced I wouldn't mind volunteering,I'm sure there would be others interested as  well,maybe even some members of our small but hardworking Japanese community would be willing to put their hearts into it!!!

You can jog, fish, go boating, play tennis, basketball, have picnics, just about anything you'd like. It's free to use so that's another good thing. There's also a snack bar with a really helpful and friendly staff. Now the bad. On this particular day I noticed tons of garbage where it didn't belong, as in a garbage can. The trash was lying next to the cans and nobody bothered to pick it up. At the basketball courts you had lots of young people playing and screaming every obscenity you can imagine. There were park employees right there and no one said a word to try and stop it. I'm certain that type of language isn't acceptable in any public park. Its still a nice place in the middle of a huge city but the employees should pay attention to the little things. ",30,March 2017

THough many may say this isn't the best park, this is the ONLY big, open space of land and nature we have around our area.

You can rent double or 4 seater bikes, enjoy the view of the sunset falling behind the trees, take your kids out to play at the playground, and there is plenty of space for hangouts and BBQ. There is a fairly big hill to stand on top of so you can overlook the park which is pretty neat. They have fit camps, and workout sessions. You can throw parties and have bounce houses and there is also a dog park.  There really is a lot to do for just about anyone. And how can I forget to mention the famous Santas Enchanted Forest!

The walls complex Is art, the galleries Are interesting and the neighborhood Is fun - well worth 2 hours or so wander.  There's a lot to see, not just within the Walls exhibit itself, but in the surrounding neighborhood; packed with tourists, but enough local flavor.  Many dining and drinking options, though shopping outside of the Levis pop-up (wow), is more of the smoke shop variety.  On a weekend afternoon, it's moved beyond 'transitional' - you can widen the circle for parking to the point where it's reasonably available and still feel comfortable.

As we went inside we noticed a lot of cages were empty, and the cages that were not empty had plenty of people around, giving attention to the animals.  I didn’t get to walk a dog, because I didn’t think it was fair of me to do so, as I obviously couldn’t take the animal on my flight home with me. This feeling became worse as I entered into another tent, and seen about 5 kittens in a cage, being playful, and awesome. I’m not a cat person, but I fully believe that the only thing stopping me from adopting one of those kittens was my flight. I really thought it was a great idea, combining a farmers market, with pet adoptions. Also, something of note here, there is a hotdog stand with a substantially sized hotdog called the Homewrecker.

Every year the park has fun activities such as Santa's Enchanted Forest, The Miami Agriculture and Cattle Show, Concerts, Sports Events, Pet Adoption Events, and lots of other fairs and activities. With the exception of Santa's Enchanted Forest, most other events held at the park have free admission and free parking. With all the corruption and greed in Miami, Tropical park is a nice exception.

There are lakes (NO SWIMMING), a huge playground, tennis courts, bike path, basketball courts, baseball diamond, wonderful pavillions, wonderful picnic tables, walking path, and plenty of SHADE.  It's all good.  There is also an AMAZING police memorial here; be sure and check it out if you are visiting the park (it's near the baseball diamonds - but across the way, closer to the expressway).  And, for us dog-lovers - the BEST dog park in Miami (in my opinion).  It is well kept and there are 2 totally separate areas - for big doggies and little doggies.  Both areas are huge.  Be aware - dogs are not allowed in other areas of the park; they can only be in the Bark Park.  The park people keep this park amazingly clean.  On the weekends, there are people who throw their trash all over, rather than in the trash cans - but the park people clean it up and by Monday, it's good as new.  Weekdays are much quieter than the busy weekends.  Great bird-watching place too!  Come and bring your family - spend all day!",50,January 2015

It is full of fun, characters, food, music, etc.  You can fine antique shops, Cuban Tabacco shops, note to mention restaurants. All types, cuban, Mexico, Colombian, etc.  There is an ice cream please call Azucar which is fantastic.  There are so many flavors that is hard to choose from.  You can find awsome entertainment in every corner.  YOu can find people sometimes dancing in the sidewalk from the cuban music coming from the restaurant.  There is a Goodwill in 8st between 12th and 9th Ave. that even though is used clothing and many good stuff it is worth the visit.  There are many brand name shoes and cloth for a very cheap price.  Worth the visit.  The dominos park is wonderful, there is nothing like little old people playing dominos.  It is a safe place to go at night.  You need to pay for parking.  Try to park in a lighted place just because there are some homeless sometimes walking around and they might be a little scary.  But nothing to worry about.  It is called litle havana because of all the Cuban that live there and the culture.  Enjoy a piece of Cuba in Miami",50,May 2018

Jungle Island,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",Journey134057,Bad place to be an animal,"It was a disappointing experience. In a tropical environment, with abundant vegetation, they had the animals locked in small cages completely empty of vegetation. I was very sorry. And at the time of the show, the speakers were at a very loud and shrill volume that was a very strong impact for the birds. The poor 3 kangaroo babies that could be touched, had to constantly endure the caresses of the children that did not stop. They looked stunned or drugged because there were always 7 or 8 children constantly handling them and they were no longer reacting. Twenty years ago I visited Monkey jungle and there the monkeys were quite free and humans walked between cages. It seems incredible that having advanced in time, the conditions in Jungle Parrot are so depressing. I will never visit it again.",20,January 2020

Lummus Park Historic District,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,Miami History Lesson,"Not to be confused with Lummus Park in Miami Beach, this Lummus Park is located in Downtown Miami. The Miami River Borders the West Side. The massive, ancient, Roman looking Scottish Rite Mason Temple Borders the North Side, and I-95 and the Hi-rises of urban Downtown Miami border the East Side. This is one of Miami's oldest parks and has been opened since the early 1900's. In addition to a playground, walking/jogging paths, and green areas for recreation there are horse stables with at least 1 live horse I observed in a corral. Most fascinating is the historical architecture within the park. You can view the preserved stone barracks of Fort Dallas, which served as slave quarters in the 1800's. You can also view another piece of architecture from the 1800's located in the park, known as the Wagner House. This is the oldest surviving house in Miami. Walking through this park is like stepping back in time, especially since there is informative signage with descriptions of each location. There are beautiful ancient oak trees in this park, but not a lot of native wildlife was observed, just one gray squirrel. Parking is free, but sadly there are only 3 spots. If those are taken, you will have to feed the meters that border the park. We will return, and let others know about this hidden historical park.",50,December 2014

The problem is this place has seen better years.  The old stairs leading to the second level are too narrow.  Seating on the second level also suffers from dangerously narrow stairs with absolutely no hand rails.  Considering most of the attendees were over 50, it was hazardous.  There is no lighting leading up any of the stairs either, people were tripping and stumbling and not from alcohol consumption.  There is only one way in and out, if there was a fire many would not be able to escape.  ",10,February 2018

I was a little disappointed in the selection of beers on draft. I visited their website before I went and hoped that I would have the opportunity to try all the beers. Unfortunately, not all beers were on tap. I had the Witch King Stout. Cool name but the beer wasn't very special. My wife had the Irish Red and it tasted average. I also had the Swayze IPA. This was the best beer I had there. They do have some nice options on the pours. My wife enjoyed the smaller pours while I enjoyed the larger ones. And the price wasn't bad either. I'd like to return and try the Lucky Machete Brown, the Barrel aged brown and the double IPA. Hopefully when I find myself back in the neighborhood, I will have the opportunity. ",30,September 2016

It keeps coming up in my news feed on Facebook and their website & videos make it look so cute, so I convinced my family it was soming we jud HAD to do over Christmas. Don't be fooled! This place is not worth the drive! We live in east Fort Lauderdale & bought the $10 discounted tickets and even for that it wasn't worth going. It is like going to play in a red neck's backyard for the day. There are some old rusted bikes to race around an overgrown badly in need of a weeding track. 2 cute, but sad looking ponies that get walked around a dirt only circle over & over again. A petting zoo, but you can actually only go in to feed the 3 goats. The other animals are in wire fenced enclosures that are off limits. All the enclosures only have dirt ground, though the chicken coop obviously has chicken coops also. The hayride is one of those no hay type hayrides south Florida seems to be known for & takes you around a boring & over grown section of their ""backyard"". There is nothing fun or interesting to see or do for the few minutes you are on this. There are paddle boats that go around an island, which I will admit was fun, but one time around & I was over it. Oh, & they have 2 old worn out bounce houses in the front area near a dirt hill that kids run around in & then go into the bounce houce with dirt all over them. Maybe this is your kind of fun, but it sure isn't mine! We will not be returning!",10,December 2015

However, the hay ride?? you go along a dirt road and see plants and the black plastic planters all piled up around everywhere. Not only nothing to see but the driver acted like he really hated his job.   The petting zoo is really bad, animals in small spaces, at least the lady working at this spot was nice.

Not a good way to bring us back, that’s all. Apart from the lunatic few that seem to revel in this behavior by the staff I certainly don’t want to waste any more dollars here. I’d advise you try a hockey or a basketball game while in town, their staff sell the product......",20,June 2017
Miami Marlins,Airport Shops,Mike S,Nice ballpark but lacks atmosphere,Visited this park in August 2017.  I visit one to two ballparks every August and have made my way through about two-thirds of them.  The stadium is outside the downtown city and not difficult to find.  I also had no issues with parking finding a spot in a parking garage right next to the stadium.  The outside is really nothing to look at but a larch concrete structure.  Also there appears to be little to do or see near the ballpark.  All seats have good sight lines so this is a plus.  Local cuisine is well represented especially a nice little area next to left field where you can have several different items representative of Miami.  The crowd the nights I were there were a little thin and quiet.  I think most came to watch Stanton so not sure why they will go now with his move to the Yankees.  It was a good experience which I elevated because of the ease of parking and the food at the ballpark.,40,August 2017

Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,Breweries,VictoriaC485,Hidden Gem in the Bird Road Art District,"There is such a good vibe at Lincoln's Beard Brewing Company from the moment you step into the place.  This  ""small"" brewpub located in the Bird Road Arts District in Miami, FL reminds me of a modern twist on old English pubs. It truly allows you the time to have great conversation while enjoying even greater craft beer. The brewery is in the process of ramping up production to have their flagship beers on tap full time.  I was told it would be in the next few weeks.  If you are lucky enough to be there when they tap pilot batches of their flagship beers or experimental beers (P. Swayze, Lucky Machete, Witch King, Monty Dreams of Barley, Mango Skyline), you are in for a craft beer treat.   The service is great and the staff is very attentive and knowledgeable.  They have recently added a permanent food truck to their beer garden area which has been a tremendous hit and pairs up nicely with their delicious craft beer.  They have weekly events to keep you entertained (trivia, karaoke).  If you are looking for a place to unwind, have fun, and drink great beer... Lincoln's Beard Brewing Company is the place to go!",50,July 2016

The petting zoo lacked animals,  but, the goat was so cute dressed as an elf..lol. They even give you a free gingerbread man cookie and you can even decorate it..that was cool. With the groupon you can use the free ticket towards either,  the paddle boats, hay rides or pony rides. The kids chose the paddle boats of course.  The man made lake was beautiful.  You must go at night to see all of the Christmas lights through out the park.  The hay ride was fun as well. The only thing the place lacked was food and activities for the kids. There was no interaction with kids and staff. Ex: games, contests, etc. Hot dogs way over priced. I spent $18 on 3 hot dogs and 2 sodas.

I went to the Pittsburgh game on Saturday 29 Apr, 4-0 loss. While I was getting my handicapped wife a $6.50 cotton candy that was just tiny, she was being asked to move because she had my ticket and I had hers, just to be clear the next seat. I watch people move around the box seats on TV at this stadium every night. No one says a thing.

We got to see the press room which is the best I have ever seen, the bobble head collection which is in a huge vending machine...you find your team mascot and punch in the number to see your mascot or your favorite player.  They have the largest multi team bobble head collection. The park has pop up restaurants (more than one)  at every game, which is unheard of.

We purchased our tickets at the ticket booth and upon entering you were searched to ensure you weren't taking in anything that you weren't suppose to, by this time I'm looking at this as an adventure. While progressing to find our seats we were given cups as souvenirs and calendars so we could follow the various dates set for events. The entire time of the match for me was fun nonstop.

Pinto's did a great job, engaging the children to visit several stations so that they could enjoy a trick or treat.  Tents were filled with a several pumpkins to select, scenic backdrops for pics, face painting, tractor hay rides, ponies and even sitings of egama along the water's landscaping.  We are intrigued by the tropical environment which included huge palms trees, 80 degree temp and the opportunity to wear shorts and witnessing a  few bright green iguanas crawling along in their nature habitat.

After we completed our scheduled activities the kids had time to play on true pedal race karts. Totally recommend this farm for families with young children.",50,February 2016

Miami City Hall,Government Buildings,Lowdslanding,A City Hall With an Unusual History,"Surrounded by the many beautifull boats tied up at the marina, the restored City Hall building was originally the Pan American Airlnes terminal for its "" Flying Clippers "" aircraft that landed in the bay after returning from their flights to South America & other destinations to the south. In the lobby of the City Hall building , you will find the large and beautifull "" Pan Am World Globe "" that was placed there when Pan Am first opened the facility back in the day. A leasurly walk by the docks and perhaps lunch or dinner at one of the well known nearby resturants will make for a very plesant visit. No charge to go inside the City Hall to see the Globe & parking is free. All welcome.",40,March 2014
Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,Breweries,sbrameister,Went for a pet event to try this place,"Saw they were hosting a pet event and decided to have a mini date night with my husband and take along our 13 year old Siberia Husky/Malamute Mix (Alusky), Nanook. Arrived around 7:30 pm, place was jammed packed, we were lucky to find parking because my husband is a disabled veteran so we have a handicap tag. Otherwise I think we would not even try to park. We actually hung out on the back patio, the inside felt a little overcrowded, I guess we are not into big crowds anymore... however, people were enjoying themselves and hanging out with their furry four legged creatures. Try their beer, was excellent. Encounter a couple of friends. Didn't eat anything, we had dinner earlier and were not hungry, however, they mentioned that the food truck parked in the back patio had some delicious Tacos. We will plan to come another day, it's nice to find a local brewery with good crafted beer. Since we didn't know how this place was at first, we didn't go with our 14 year old son, he actually was attending student services and activities at church, so it was a win win. It's a casual place, we saw actually people with very small children (3,6 years old), I would not think to take small children but to each its own, not judging but it would not be my option. The host different events during the month, we are learning more about it. But definitely will come back, when it's not too busy. They have live music on Thursday and Friday. I like to support small businesses.",40,February 2017

It took us about 30 minutes from the 95 exit to get into the garage (due to congestion we got routed 1 block away and had to continue a few blocks further as result of roads closed for construction). The garage has direct access to JLKC which we found convenient. The venue itself is quite dated - limited number of restrooms which are spaced too far apart, hallways are not well laid out and funnel to 1 central corridor so before and after show it was very slow to move about, soiled carpets and smudged windows needed cleaned throughout, and inside the concert hall it was way too warm.

Not nearly enough for a crowd this size. We had tickets in “orchestra” which consisted of folding chairs in poorly marked, very narrow rows on the floor of the theatre. Very strange. The staff couldn’t find our row/seats. When,  they finally figured it out, the show had started and the entire row had to stand up because rows were so narrow. The theatre was very warm, stuffy. On the positive side, the bar set up was fairly efficient. We will not be back. ",20,February 2018

The three large hangars were where the fleet was serviced and maintained.  In 1954 it became Miami City Hall after Pan Am terminated seaplane operations.

Parking is an issue but they have a file card system to put on your dash in case you double park.   Being a largely industrial area, no easy parking options around and they warn about towing.

Shark Valley Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,sweetjustine,Incredible ecosystem,"My husband and I drove the I41 from Miami to Marco Island and stopped at the Visitor Centre. The drive was easy and picturesque. Two lanes most of the time. Good signage. Not really knowing what to expect we are so glad we stopped. We took the 2hr covered tram ride to the observation walkway (45 mins there and then back) The cost ($19 for seniors plus $30 entrance fee) was higher than we expected but at least the money goes towards maintaining the park! The visitor centre has a small shop, water fountain and basic but clean restrooms. The guide and tram driver were very well informed and provided interesting commentary whilst pointing out the wildlife and stoping to allow visitors to take photographs. Recommend sitting on the non driver side on the way to the walkway and on the drivers side on the way back to get the best views. We saw baby alligators, an alligator nest, 4 adult alligators, turtles, dragonflies, tilapia fish and a variety of birds including egrets and herons. We had about 20 mins at the observation centre which is easy to access and has clean restrooms.  No mosquitoes! The tram driver had cold bottled water on board for sale ($1).

It feels like you are sinking down in them and there are tears on the backs of the chairs.  The seats are made for short, skinny people.  I was squished in my seat and could not even share the armrest as the person sitting next to me was a big girl.  I am only 5'3'' and my knees almost touched the chair in front of me.  The girl next to me looked very uncomfortable as her knees were touching the seat in front of her with her legs bent back.  The good part of this place is the outside.

No enough parking space, a long line to enter the place (even though I bought the tickets online, they asked us to make the huge line to enter). The advertisement stated unlimited rides but it was impossible to enjoy any of the rides since the lines were huge. They sold tickets without taking into account how many people they could handle. The place was terribly crowded. The Egg hunting was awful, faked eggs made with polyfoam, nothing inside the eggs, not chocolate eggs, and not enough, if you were lucky you could find one, most of the kids were crying and complaining because they got nothing. It was very disrespectful to sell tickets for such a disappointing experience. I won't go never again.",10,April 2019

Shark Valley Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,AmosRedux,Ranger led activity,"We went on the ""Glades in the Morning"" tour. We were guided by a ranger (Deana) as we rode the 15 mile Shark Valley Bicycle Loop. We saw 40 alligators (20 adults and 20 babies), herons, Ibis, Anhingas, and Cormorants. Deana also told us about the history and development of the Everglades. She was very engaging and informative. About half way is an observation tower where you can see the Everglades for miles in every direction. After the tour, we rode the bike loop again on our own. There are also some short walking trails. The visitor center has water, flush toilets, tram rides, bicycle rentals, vending machines, and a souvenir shop. Well worth the entrance fee.",40,January 2020

Shark Valley Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,DiverM,Park outside if crowded. Bike ride carefully.,We did this for the first time today and enjoyed it. There is one 15 mile loop which the tram does for $27 or you can rent a bike or ride your own. The park fills up early and it can be most efficient to park on Tamiami trail and ride your bike in. The park costs $30 to enter. You might consider an annual national parks pass for $80. A surprising number of people had bike wipeouts so be careful. I would also advise slower traffic to ride along one side and those who ride fast to be careful passing.  ,40,February 2020
Shark Valley Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,thehikingharpist,"Crowded when I went, but my favorite visitor center at the Everglades","At 2pm on a Wednesday in January, we had to wait about 20 minutes to enter Shark Valley. The rangers implement a car-in, car-out process, so if the lot is full, you need to wait until a car leaves to be allowed in. Luckily, it was late enough that people were leaving pretty regularly, and once we got into the visitor center lot, at least we were guaranteed a parking spot! The visitor center was great. Lots of information, helpful rangers and staff, and a hub for activities such as the tram tour and bike rentals. I opted to rent a bike and ride the Shark Valley Loop trail. The visitor center has clean, working facilities and a fountain to fill water bottles.",50,January 2020
Shark Valley Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,ananda6,The Bike ride with Alligators was Awesome!,"I took my 11 year old son to the Everglades in February 2020. We wanted to see the park and its inhabitants without the noise of a tour. For $9/hr you can rent a comfy, yet heavy cruiser bike. The loop you travel on is paved and is 15 miles long with mile markers. You start along a man made canal and right from the start you see blue herons, cormorants, green herons, other birds I did not recognize and tons of alligators and various turtles. What a beautiful, beautiful park! There was a good head wind that really tired my son out. Fortunately we made it to the observation tower at the half way point ( which was gorgeous) and bike renters can take the tram back for free if they get tired. We were instructed to leave his bike at the tower and they allowed him to ride solo while I raced him back ( which was a lot of fun). It was hot and muggy, but bug-free on the day we went. I am a runner so I found the ride easy. It was tough for a kid from MA who isn't used to the heat. The second half of the ride was lovely with tons of fields and water features, but less alligators. I saw some folks finish the circuit in an hour. It took us 3-4 hours with plenty of breaks and bird watching.",50,February 2020

Spanish Marie Brewery,Breweries,Scott W,Amazing beers in south west Kendall in low key location,"Finally had a chance to go here on a Sunday.   It is located in a strip mall at one side of the Tamiami Airport (near a church so parking on Sundays can be difficult).   They have  15 of their own brews plus 5 or so guest brews, two wines and soft drinks.   The brewmaster was working the bar, Jaime and he helped us select what we wanted.   Flights can come up to six beers and are priced at the 5 oz rate (about $3.50) for each beer.   Pints run in the $7 and $9 range.    Between the two of us we tried almost everything and liked every beer.   Jaime seems to have a magic touch at blending different ingredients and flavors so they are all present but don't overpower each other or leave an aftertaste.   The fruit infused beers (mango, passion fruit and guava) were great as was the French Vanilla Coffee porter (#10).   I wish they had some red/amber beers.   The two brown ales were amazing.   Being a Sunday they had wings for sale and the Fins game on the huge TV screen.   This place seems to have a regular crowd and it is dog friendly.   They only opened in May and don't have much distribution worked out yet so I hope they last as their selection and quality of beers is phenomenal.   Open at noon on weekends and 4 pms during the week.   Beers are discounted $1 I think during happy hours and Fins games.   The place is small with about 10 stools at the bar and half a dozen tables or so seating 4.   They are working out the kinks to have a food truck nearby, otherwise no food (except wings they had for the game).   I think this place can get noisy since it is small and with high ceilings.   They use a 7 barrel brewing system.    Music is there but not too loud.  Will definitely go back as Jaime mentioned they are always trying new brews.",50,September 2018

Maurice A. Ferre Park,Parks,805donaldk,Stroll Biscayne Bay,"This January the cruise ship I took from Baltimore visited Miami.  On prior occasions South Beach was our favorite excursion.  With the weather in mind we decided to take a walk from the ship to explore a segment of downtown Miami.  Biscayne boulevard and the Freedom Tower are a short one mile walk from the cruise port across a auto/pedestrian bridge.  Our goal ultimately was Museum Park, an additional half mile down Biscayne Blvd.  What a great decision on our part.  The park offers several different paths to enjoy for shade in the summer and pleasant breezes in the winter.  The outer path goes along the bay giving views of the cruise port, MacArthur Causeway and the birds of the bay.  We ended our walk at the art museum.  Although we did not tour the museum we enjoyed the swing chairs on the museum patio and the hanging gardens around the museum.  On the way back to the bridge we to took a side trip to go to the Freedom tower circulator stop.  We rode the free circulator loop route around downtown planning places to go on future visits to Miami.  By the time we returned to the ship our exercise trackers indicated that we walked an easy four miles over 3 hours.  South beach is a good beach/bar destination but there is much more to enjoy outside of the beach.",50,January 2019

Since I was little I have visited this park hundreds of times, including the yearly Dade County Fair held on the property. Unfortunately the fair enjoyed by thousands every year will not happen again here. Neighboring FIU recently did a land grab and acquired the land used by the Fair so that they can construct more buildings and increase their own revenue and enrollment.

The price was decent and I wanted a larger vehicle for my family.  On the positive side the car (aside from a flat tire) was decent and the people at the rental agency were friendly.  On the negative side the office closes at 8pm and when arriving there's no  way to pick up a car after 8pm.  My flight arrived a little after 8 so I had to pay for transport to and from my hotel and pick up the car the following day.  When I tried to get compensated for this and reimbursed for one night I got bounced around from Sixt San Juan to the corporate customer service and back to Sixt San Juan franchise.  After finally tracking down the cost. service person at the local franchise in San Juan she wouldn't reimburse my anything because my flight got in at 845pm and it was my responsibility to see the hours of operation.  Well I've rented cars probably over a hundred times and it's normal to pick cars up very late, so end of story.

When booking refused all types of insurance.  When I received the car at the airport, the manager once again offered to purchase additional insurance, which I refused verbally twice, after all the registration procedures, the manager asked me to sign a booking confirmation on the tablet, not voicing any additional information and not showing any prices.  I signed, in full confidence that the price remained according to the value specified in the application.  I took the car, drove it perfectly for 6 days, returned it, after which I receive an account in the mail in which the final cost of renting a car is two times higher than the initial price, due to the fact that the manager included insurance there, which I refused twice  !  I am sure that managers receive additional commission for themselves from the sale of additional options, and he did it on purpose!  I think this is pure fraud!

I go every time I'm in Miami and each visit is a pleasure.  It's a fairly small museum but they have really first rate shows and one of the best museum stores anywhere.  They are currently in a fundraising drive to expand and I do wish them good fortune on this endeavor.  Current exhibition includes works by Ed Ruscha and Ragnar Kjartansson from Iceland.  Kjartansson's video pieces are both funny and thought provoking.   Unlike many galleries and museums the staff at MOCA are exceedingly helpful and friendly.  In fact on my last visit I got into an intelligent conversation with one of the security guards about one of Kjartansson's videos.  If you're staying in Miami Beach MOCA is straight up I-95 to NE 125th Street.  Not the best of neighborhoods but well worth the trip.",50,August 2012

The price was wonderful and they were pleased to meet us and take care of our every request.  I had researched other operators in the area and had actually selected another business.  I had made all the arrangements in advance with the other operator (Miami Ski Paradise) and the day before departure I got an e-mail saying they were cancelling because nobody was available.  I found out they had an older boat that broke down a lot.  The Gator Bate boat was a brand new 2015 Super Air Nautique and incredible.  Don't let a good looking website lead you the wrong way!

I didn't see much of a permanent collection.  The current exhibit really wasn't an exhibit.  MOCA had invited several artists to move their studios to the galleries (Trading Places).  Only one of the artists was present on a weekend and it was pleasant to talk to him about his drawings and concepts.  The rest of the studios in the galleries were unmanned and pretty disorganized. Before going to MOCA I'd check online to make sure that there is an exhibit that interests you. Parking is free and convenient.,30,November 2012

Museum of Contemporary Art,Art Museums,yucatenor,Meeting Ground for Miami's Artistically Pretentious,"Caveat: I have only visited the museum during exhibition opening events.  I've never gone there by myself, during the day to experience an exhibit.  That said, *every* time I've gone there for the opening of an exhibit, I encounter the most rude, unfriendly staff and volunteers of any organization in Miami, and that is saying a lot.  MOCA draws to itself a plastic, monied groups of patrons who know (and care) little to nothing about art who are cold and unfriendly.  To me, they are caricatures of ""social Miami.""  I will never return for any of these events.  And, their exhibits are not unique or groundbreaking.  There are scores of galleries in Wynwood that have much finer collections with passionate, friendly inviting staff and patrons.  The one exception to this review is MOCA's music series.  Every now and then, they have Jazz at MOCA, which is outside, under the stars.  Those events are free and often quite nice.  Since they are outside, you don't have to deal with any of MOCA's staff.  I do appreciate the free music concerts, and am thankful for them.",20,

Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,David G,Beware of Sixt,"We had many issues with this company while renting a car to attend a funeral, but I’ll just mention three items to give you an idea what you’d be dealing with if you rented from Sixt.  The shuttle driver was on his cell while driving on multi lane highway. Which is illegal in DC where we were renting.  It took 1 hour 25 minutes to process our advance reservation (There was only one couple in front of us). Another 20 minutes to be given the car.  And finally,  they’re harassing us to collect our insurance details to open a claim for a slow leak from a nail in one of the tires. What’s relevant to this issue is that there’s a renovation going on at Sixt, and the dumpster for the gutting of the space is in the same location as where the cars are dispatched from.  So they’re most likely responsible for the puncture and it’s not even clear that the car was my responsibility when the puncture occurred.  Furthermore, it’s less than $20 to repair a puncture. Probably less than that for them to fix since they have someone on staff for small issues.  So why are thy trying to get my insurance details for what they are writing up as an “accident”.  They’ve asked me if I called the police to have a report made.  Gathered witness statements. And more.  For a puncture.  Beware of this predatory business.",10,September 2019

No car rental company - not Hertz, or Avis, or Enterprise, etc - does this. Sixt said: this is our policy. But it's a BAD policy! No amount of reasoning and logic worked on them.

Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,entropy71,I will never use Sixt again,"Sixt is the worst of the crooks that call themselves car rental companies. I trusted them as they are a big German company. Their on-line tease rate was 167 EUR for 5 days in Europe, for a ""premium sedan like a Mercedes, Audi or similar"". This was a good rate so I fell for it. By the time I was done with the reservation, the amount was 765% higher (this is not a typo): they added 672 EUR for a one-way drop-off charge (in Zadar, Croatia), 34 EUR for a GPS, 201 EUR for airport delivery fee, and 204 EUR for local taxes, a total of 1277 EUR. By the time Ii picked up the car in Munich, my credit card had changed. Although I had pre-paid the rental, they charged me the whole amount once more on the new card, with a promise of a refund. Yes, they refunded it, but $ 65 less than the pre-paid amound, presumably due to different exchange rate - in their favor, of course. At the airport they informed me that premium brands like Mercedes and Audi cannot be taken to Eastern Europe (although inside EU!) . Although this can be found in the ""fine print"", why did they accept my reservation when it was obvious (from the one-way drop-off fee) that I was driving to Croatia?! Instead they offered me a Skoda Superb station wagon. Many car rentals use this trick to give you a station wagon version of a lesser model and call it ""equivalent"" to a sedan of a bigger model. To any reasonable person, a Skoda station wagon is not equivalent to a ""premium sedan"", which I had paid for, no matter how well equipped it was. When I complained about this point, they gave me a 15% discount, but on the rental fee of 167 EUR, not on the total bill of 1277 EUR, so it was a drop in the bucket. The alternative was to cancel the reservation and walk away. But they know that it is easy to blackmail a tired and stranded tourist, who will sign anything after an overnight flight.",10,September 2019
Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,justinr2406,Terrible company,"Rented a minivan for my wife myself and 4 other friends we were traveling to Germany for 11 days. We prepaid the booking including the additional insurance before we left Canada so it was taken care of prior to our arrival. We checked in at the counter and gave them our licenses and signed paperwork to add the additional driver at a cost of 44 euros for the entire trip. The agent at the counter was not bilingual and we were having a hard time understanding her and vise versa. We thought everything was great until a week after we got home and I got a notification on my phone that my MasterCard had been charged for $714.36 Canadian. When I called them and stated it was a prepaid booking and enquired about the extra charges and I was told I was charged $15.96 euros per day for loss damage waiver, $4.19 euros per day for tire and windshield protection, $5.03 euros per day for roadside assistance  and the $44.12 euros for the additional driver. When I filed a formal complaint via email to the company and spoke with a rep on the phone I was told I signed the paperwork (all written in German which I don’t speak or write) acknowledging the charges and that it is not their responsibility to have a fluent English speaking  rep to assist me. So needless to say I’ve paid the credit card charges since they are unwilling to cooperate with me. I will however never book with Sixt rent a car anywhere in the world when I travel abroad and I strongly suggest anyone that reads this rating do the same. Save yourself the headaches and book with a reputable company",10,September 2019

Rather than trying to cover contemporary art, the museum rotates its exhibits.  On the day we visited, the British contemporary artist Tracey Emin was the entire exhibit.  Although her work would not be everyone's taste, it has received a measure of acclaim throughout the world.  MOCA displays part of her work, a whole lot of neon signs plus an 18 year old film she did of her dancing after recalling her teenage sexual adventures and misadventures.  Yes, not everyone's taste in art.  But, that is art.  It was a worthwhile hour and worth the modest admission charge.  Free parking in adjacent public parking lots.",40,December 2013

AVOID!,"When I returned from my trip, I found my credit card charged $192 for the lost key (fair enough), but an additional charge was made for $586 for a scratch that I was not notified of, and had absolutely nothing to do with. I was also charged an extra day charged. They provided no evidence of damage until I appealed (twice). I was later supplied with low resolution photos taken with flash at night of the car, and photos of a scratch - location on the car and size undisclosed. Their email said the car was towed rather than opened because the parking brake had been ""engaged on the hill"". The car was left on the flat at the ferry dock in P (no additional brake). They said they would open the car with the help of a local dealer, but subsequently communicated it had been towed (which could well have scratched the vehicle. No notification, no repair quote, nothing until queried. If I hadn't checked my statement carefully, they would have slipped it past my attention.  Single day rental, total charges now exceed $900.

After booking through Priceline, we arrive at the Las Vegas Sixt Rent a Car. My husband and I have one account with two cards. As I usually book vacations I did so using my card. So they tell me he cannot drive because I booked with a card not in his name. I finally said okay then I’ll drive. Then they said no, you already listed him as a driver. I said okay fine change that. No they can’t. I said what do we do? He told me he had cancelled my booking with Priceline and to give him my husbands card and after a $500 deposit and over $300 because there is a new price now, they would rebook. I repeatedly asked if I will get my refund from Priceline, and he said yes. Priceline has since said that is not true, they do it issue cancellation or refund, that Sixt would have to...I then asked for a receipt or proof of cancellation and he refused. I pressed him and asked why won’t he show me proof he cancelled so he just looks at me with guilt all over his face.  I then became suspicious and told him there’s no way without a receipt or proof I will be refunded for the booking though Priceline am  I’m letting him charge our card. He refuses. So we were stranded. We walked with our luggage back to the airport, went to NATIONAL CAR RENTAL. It was quick and easy to book a brand new car with no hassle and ZERO deposit. Please save yourself by going to a reputable place like National. Thanks to National we ended up having a fabulous vacation. No thanks to Sixt we are out of $300 they completely stole from us. As I was sitting there I saw a similar sensor happening over and over to customers. I don’t know how these employees sleep at night after a full day of scamming customers. Don’t use Priceline either as they will take no responsibility when things go wrong. I really wish I had seen all these bad reviews before I booked. THEY ARE ALL VERY ACCURATE.",10,August 2019

Won’t do business with this company again,10,June 2019
Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,shar8052,Rental car,"We rented a car on line for San Diego. I believe main office is in Florida. We paid in advance & needed to add a day to rental. You can not speak with an agent. They dont answer phone and message tells you to go on line. We were unsuccessful to get an update reservation we would have to pay approx $85 to change reservation. No help from Sixt even though reservation would have been Approx $100 cheaper if we rented at that time. When we picked up car they asked if we wanted upgrade, gas, ins. Etc. my husband opted for pay up front gas. We gave credit card & was told only new charges would be charged. The entire rental was charged again. I tried to contact Sixt but again  message on phone referred to web site. I inquired about charge- no response for 3 days & then i was told reservation can only be discussed with my husband. Why couldnt they just say a refund was in process & it takes several days to show up in credit card, instead i had to call credit card & stop the second charge but luckily credit card co called me afterSixt wouldnt tell me anything that a credit was posted. I like to deal with companys that have real people not emails if there is an issue",10,June 2019
Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,AngelaKavSA,Worst rental company in Italy,"Unpleasant experience all the way. Booked a car from Naples, however when we arrived they no longer had the class we had booked so we had to take the class higher, which added an additional 6€ per day. Our train connections were late, but we had no way of knowing this or communicating it with the company. They are aware people's planes/trains etc get delayed but would rather charge the additional payment instead of give you the car you booked. On returning the car, they give you the closest petrol station to fill up at. Clearly getting some sort of kick-back because the price of petrol at this station (which was crummy and attendance were dodge) was well over 2€s. The very next station was under 1.6€. It leaves a very poor taste on your mouth and hence would not recommend this company to anyone.",10,July 2019
Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,eric000001,Worst rental car place,"I booked a week long rental for a mid size car for my vacation with Sixt car rental.  My flight with Spirit airlines was cancelled unexpectedly so we had to be inconvenienced and reshuffle our itinerary. Sixt car rental refused to give us a refund and charged us for 3 days. Customer service is all through emails and Sixt car rental doesn't care about their customers. Even when we wanted to change the rental days to fit our new schedule they still charged us 3 days from the old schedule and just emailed me their cancellation rules. The cancellation was out of my hands due to the cancelled flight and they still charged me. I would not recommend Sixt car rental to anyone. They arent even located at the airport, they are far away from Fort Myers airport. We wound up using enterprise which is right outside the airport. They were awesome. You pay when you get there and pick your vehicle out. They know how to treat their customers. Don't waste your time with Sixt they are terrible!",10,July 2019
Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,JeffJ5333,Excessive Charges - Beware!!!!,"I received a charge on my credit card in excess of $500 euro. The scuff could have been buffed out in 2 minutes with wax. Beware, this is a ploy to extort additional fees from customers.",30,June 2019

Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,mcgillmba,Refused to cancel and refund reservation despite Covid-19 travel restrictions,"Despite every decent airline, hotel and rental car company allowing free cancellations due to the coronavirus crisis, Sixt refuses to do so.  We are being forced to cancel our travel plans due to restrictions posed by the Canadian government on leisure travel.  Our airline and lodging were refunded no questions asked, despite being booked as ""non-refundable"", due to the pandemic.  And then there is Sixt.   I got the ""We will be happy to rebook for a different date at a higher rate"".  What a joke, as if anyone knows when this is over and we will be able to travel again.",10,March 2020
Sixt Rent a Car,Points of Interest & Landmarks,Shar1805,I wish I had read the awful reviews before choosing Sixt,"We arrived at Sixt at 6 am and it seemed like the employees were either about to leave or had just arrived.

All 5 companies I booked something with gave me full refunds due to extenuating circumstances.  I contacted their customer support and was informed they are sticking to their standard policy so I get charged 3 days and refunded 1 day.  There are plenty of car rental companies standing by their customers during these difficult times.  I won’t be using them again.,10,March 2020

Compare that to an item from the grocery store that goes sale just before it is about to collapse. I swear the spinach lasts twice as long as store bought.

Olympia Theater,Theaters,tjelke,South Florida Gem,"I have seen a few dozen performances/films at this theater dating back to my childhood.  Most recently, the Film Festival (Juan of the Dead was awesome) and took my kid to see the Nutcracker.  There is no more majestic theater in South Florida in my opinion.  Sure there are bigger ones, and flashier ones even, but the Olympia/Gusman sends you back to another time when theater was a regal event.  Comfortable seats, ample space, consistently great acoustics.  The restoration, as has been noted by others, added the final polish to this gem.  It won't be a hidden gem for long as people are already noticing.",50,March 2012

He was friendly and gave clear instructions, without overwhelming us.  My son and I both got up on our first or second try, and I've struggled waterskiing in the past.  Started with the basics, and he had us do more in small steps as he saw us improving.  We paid for an hour but I bet we were out a little longer than that.

The layout of the floor was not that good, you really had to make sure you looked everywhere to not miss anything. They had about the same amount of classic cars but in that big room it looked pretty empty. Million dollar alley was pretty good with some really nice cars. There was an extreme lack of vendors, not sure why. Camp Jeep was great outside and much bigger than years past. The test drives were nice but not sure how effective on the streets of Miami. The absolute worst part was the parking. I know the convention center is going thru a remodel but if they don't figure it out by next year, i will skip going.

I love Keez Beez honey products, the Indian fresh food products (the vegetarian samosas are to die for!), the French baker with his wonderful breads, and of course, the food market itself. There are prepared salads, deserts, sushi, fresh cold pressed juices, coconut waters, and just about anything a vegan could wish for. Even if you are not vegan there are plenty of yummy nutritious things that you can try. It is quite busy but I have always found a spot at the picnic table and have never been disappointed in the food. Although you must be prepared to pay the price of organic vegetables and raw food items. They are good but they are pricey. $8.75 for a small bunch of asparagus is quite steep and a dozen of farm fresh organic eggs will cost you anywhere from $8-10. However, you can be assured that you will find every raw food, organic, vegan item all in one place and the quality is assured. You can see the difference when you compare to the local grocery stores and also in the taste. I highly recommend this market, oh did I mention the umami vegan burgers? :-)",40,October 2016
Coconut Grove Organic Market,Flea & Street Markets,WDUK,"Good option to buy fresh, organic produce if you live in the area","I have been here a couple of times now. It's one of the better farmer's markets in the area with a wide selection of fresh produce. Seems like a lot of the produce is from the same farms that Whole Foods carries, and is not local, however the produce is fresher than what you would buy at Whole Foods and that's why we come here. They also have a wide selection of specialty items produced by Glaser Farms including ice-cream, drinks and prepared food. Great quality although expensive especially if you need to eat a lot of vegan food to fill up and feel like you've had a good lunch! It gets very busy under the produce tent with lines of people waiting to pay for their items, but the checkout is efficient and it seems to move quickly. They also have some smaller vendors outside the main produce tent, including lots of vegan food options.",40,August 2017
Museum of Contemporary Art,Art Museums,johnny46915,Interesting but small,The building itself is interesting and the exhibits are good also but you would think that for a city this large they would have a much bigger museum for contemporary art .

Literally one of a kind!,"I was headed to catch a Lyft ride to the airport when two guys on the street approached me and told me I should visit the museum. They said it was the only graffiti museum in the US, so I decided to turn back around. I'm very happy I did as it was a highlight of the trip. The museum employees are very passionate about their work and I believe are artists themselves. I gained a new appreciation for street art after learning to paint earlier that day at the The Light Box. The museum was a great way to reiterate that experience. It's a small museum, but no shortage of history and affordable art for sale. When you go to other museums (at least in my experience), you kind of wonder around on your own. Here, you can ask lots of questions and really get into conversations about the art. I was happy to support them by also purchasing a book and a few other things. They even threw in a magazine which was super nice and made my day.  (It was my birthday, but they didn't know that.)  I will be back.",50,February 2020

Maurice A. Ferre Park,Parks,Annalisad65,Respite in Miami,"Museum Park is a gorgeous undulating green expanse of 30 acres located in downtown Miami, east of Biscayne Boulevard and hugging the bay. Aptly named, the park is home to the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science and Perez Art Museum Miami (PAMM). Two other cultural institutions, Museum of Art And Design (MOAD) in historic Freedom Tower and the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, are just a few short blocks away. The late and famed architect Zaha Hadid’s One Thousand Museum, a stunning architectural gem, is located directly opposite the park and the American Airlines Arena separates it from Bayfront Park to the south. Museum Park offers a welcome respite from the baking heat of downtown streets where the sound of construction and the constant hum of traffic is omnipresent. I took a long cycle through the park early this July 4th morning. Most people were either sleeping in or away for the long weekend as it was quieter than usual. There are several walking/cycling paths and copses of shade trees throughout the park where permanent outdoor sculptures provide points of interest. The beautiful bay walk stretches all the way from PAMM and connects to a long promenade that serves as the main point of entry to the park. The spectacular 20-foot bronze sculpture, “Flora la Recogedora de Suenos,” dedicated to the City of Miami in 2010, is located at this entrance. Breathtaking views of the ocean as well as the glittering and ever evolving Miami skyline surround the park. Ramps provide access to the museums’ terraces and gardens. There are plenty of benches and shaded spots to relax. Museum Park is flawlessly designed and esthetically pleasing to the eyes. The Metromover has a convenient station stop here and parking is available at the museums. A visit to Museum Park is a downtown must!",50,July 2019

Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,"Historic Sites, Architectural Buildings",Experience406894,Admire Tower of Snow as part of your trip to Freedom Tower,"My first closeup visit to Freedom Tower was back in January of 2017 before boarding Celebrity Reflection with my wife. Though somewhat dwarfed by its modern surroundings, including Miami's sports center right across the street, Freedom Tower holds a place of its own along Miami's shoreline as a unique and magnificent landmark with a history, and, may I add, a good companion in the nearby sculpture known as ""Tower of Snow"". The sculpture's name is at best misleading, for a visitor would first take into view a giant human figure on crutches, as if ready to fall apart at any time. The first time I saw that sculpture, I could sense that there must be a good story behind it, though there was nothing in the form of a sign nearby or description of its history and, more importantly, its message. I have since learned to my immense inspiration that the sculpture was the creation of a Cuban artist, who came to the United States as an unaccompanied child among many others in similar circumstances in the 1960s. In retrospect, I found my then ignorance to be better than any informed knowledge of the nature of this silent yet speaking sculpture. Its message of someone with a heavy heart and burden on his shoulder could and did transcend its own silence to me by conveying to its viewers such as me a sense of its unspoken significance. Knowing what I have since come to know of the provenance and historical significance of this sculpture, I would have appreciated much more my cruise to come on Celebrity Reflection. With that in the back of my mind, each time I am approaching the Miami cruise port, I would be searching, on the top deck of my cruise ship, for the image of Freedom Tower  in the distance, as if to say, ""Freedom Tower, I am back."" My greeting must be meant for that nearby Tower of Snow as well. ",50,November 2018

We had originally hesitated about visiting just before sunset because we were worried it wouldn't feel safe for two women to walk around this area at night. We were told by locals to just stay with the crowds and in the well-lit areas of Wynwood (common sense, really) and it didn't feel sketchy at all.

Deering Estate,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Specialty Museums, Historic Sites",Michelle W,Well worth the drive_eco-historical-art rolled into one,"It took me a while to learn how far south to go on Old Cutler to find this wonderful park, but it was completely worth it .With its beautifully restored buildings, amazing history, and nature trails through a variety of South Florida ecosystems, the site offers a lot for the photographer, artist, history or architecture buff, and just your everyday tourist.   For nearly 100 years, the oldest building on site, the ""Richmond Cottage"" was the only hotel between Miami and Key West. Today, sitting on the veranda in the comfortable rocking chairs, it is like a step back in time and great for a contemplative moment on a quiet day.  DO NOT MISS THE TOUR of the buildings as there is a lot of history here - spanning  occupancy the Tequesta, South Florida's first inhabitants,  emergence of the area as one of the first communities in South Florida, and, finally,  the construction of the elegant 'rock house' for the art collection of Charles Deering, (brother of James Deering who built Viscaya in Coconut Grove). You especially want to hear about the underground wine cellar, given that so much of Miami's early heydey was during prohibition.    Be sure to consult the website as there are  special programs -   yoga by moonlight, Father's Day fishing trip,  concerts, nature walks,  and guided tours (by boat)  of 'Stiltsville"",  a protected historical area of Biscayne Bay.

Monkey Jungle,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",djanchondo,Private Tour,"The staff at Monkey Jungle was courteous and honest with my wife and I the day we showed up. Storms were in the area and they offer a rain check for instances such as these. Luckily for us, everything worked out just fine! Bailey was our guide and she provided us (and the monkeys) with a positive experience! She was very knowledgeable about the monkeys and their behaviors/individuality. During the tour the monkeys surround you and you basically get lost in the experience. You also get the feel of being in an actual rain forest with the trees you're surrounded by. Bailey didn't spend time interfering with our interactions, but rather let us take it all in and enjoy it while answering any questions we had and enhancing the experience for us. The tour takes about 45 minutes and with a small group (ours was 4 people) the food lasted every minute of the experience so we were never short on interactions! 10/10 times I would spend the money on this tour.

The Macaques area has 150 monkeys in 7 acres.  Because of the set up, monkeys are able to form social structures, hunt for food, and live very much like they would in the wild.  They have three main areas - the Macaques, the squirrel monkeys, and the gorilla.  There are also a few other animals in smaller cages.  There are three ""shows"" that allow you to see and learn about the animals and also you can walk around and feed the monkeys raisins.  There is a small snack bar that has very limited selections but there is pizza so if you are there at lunch time you don't have to worry about food.  I highly recommend this place especially with young kids.",50,June 2019

I asked the guy working if this is normal, his response was, ""what do you expect, they are animals"".  The most apathetic, rude response I've ever gotten. He could not care less. What do I expect for a petting zoo for all ages? Not to leave with a my baby girl's/ busted face from falling and a bruise on her ribs from the goats.

Outside, the building itself is gorgeous with the hanging gardens, views of the water, and great architecture.  Parking was very easy and shaded (obviously, as it is underground).  However, the art itself was lacking.  My initial impression was that the majority of pieces chosen for exhibition were perhaps from budding middle and high school programs in the area -which would be fantastic if it were offset with more quality pieces.  However, I've seen better collections housed in universities and even boutique hotels throughout the US.  Perhaps we visited the Perez during an 'off' season.",20,August 2019

Perez Art Museum Miami,Art Museums,WCH999,Awesome museum. HORRIBLE PARKING ATTENDANTS ,The Perez Art museum is a wonderful asset for South Florida. Their current special exhibitions are remarkable. The Bayside location is unmatched at any other museum I’ve ever been to. It reminds me a bit of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston however there is a huge park south of the Perez museum that blows the way ICA Boston.  The parking is a pain. The museum is a four dollar discount to members. And you must remember to get your ticket registered at the desk. I advise you to keep this ticket in pristine shape as my ticket that was less than perfect and was eaten by their machine. The attendants tried to charge me eight extra dollars (by the time I could get to a manager the ticket was into the fourth hour and they refused to acknowledge my discount for being a member). The manager did agreed to except $12 but insisted on cash and insisted on taking a picture of my drivers license. At this point I gave up and allowed her to snap a picture of my ID and paid the $12 in cash. My change was in one dollar bills of course. On the other hand they have free electric car charging. I have heard (but not confirmed) that if the lot is otherwise full and you are in an electric car you can still park if a spot at the charging station is open. There are some times when this could come in handy. Avoid interacting with the parking attendants if at all possible.,50,August 2019

Perez Art Museum Miami,Art Museums,allthegirls2014,Middle schoolers love modern art!,"I brought my 7th grade religious school class here to see the George Segal sculpture ""Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael"". Truthfully, I had low expectations of the possibly lethal combination of middle school and modern art, but I was completely and totally wrong. The museum's architecture and collection were absolutely thrilling to them. Every artwork and vista was getting instagrammed and Snapchatted and we even stayed in the room where the Segal sculpture is installed for about 20 minutes, discussing the piece and what we had previously studied. We walked about for about an hour; we could have probably stayed for longer. I encourage parents and teachers to take even  their recalcitrant kids to view modern art. Their minds seem open to grasping the skills and the techniques, discovering the materials and trying to discern meaning from even the least figurative of subjects. The gorgeous views from the veranda and the interactivity of some the outdoor installations were also very tempting. What a delightful morning!",50,December 2019

It's an onteresting place and on another trip I will probably give it time again.  My one gripe is parking.  If you're visitng from outside Miami, you're pretty much forced to use their garage.  Which is rutted and leaky - architechts did not plan this very well.  For $12 or more you're abused, and there are no other options.  That, plus admission fee, makes this a less than stellar value.  Metromover (a hike) is an option - IF you're staying in the city and have access to it.",40,December 2019

However, the exhibit were unimpressive to say the least. There wasn't one exhibit that I would consider worthy of showing. It was an absolute waste of time and money.

The gardens and sculptures outside the building are impressive and make some very nice photo ops right by the bay. Inside you will see some very impressive and not so impressive art. Frankly I probably wouldn't hang 90% of the pieces in my home but still very fun to look at and figure out ""why is this in a museum??"". Take your time and watch the films also.

Frankly, some of the exhibits were just plain ridiculous. Numerous works did not have placards with the artist's name, etc leaving one to wonder if they were, in fact, part of the collection.

It’s true that is does not have the variety of hot and cold appetizers and soups of some lounges, but its modest assortment is fairly good.  When we first arrived the main food offering was hummus with pita bread.  Also available were fresh fruit, a variety of types of potato chips, pretzels alone and as part of a mix, cookies, and granola bars.  A bit later a mix of chopped raw veggies also appeared.  As for beverages, there is a self-serve fountain for soft drinks as well as self-serve coffee, wine, beer, and hard liquor.  And by the way, the ladies’ room was clean.

They stay open until all the flights leave for their business/first class passenger section, but will start kicking you out at 8:45 on the Priority Pass side. There's minimal food spread, and beverage is almost non-existent. The only reason why this lounge survives is because terminal F is the oldest one in MIA, and not connected to the others one after security. All the other lounges in the other terminals are much better. Additionally, the staff tends to be rude even for Miami standards (I'm a local).

We then went to the club America lounge and were pleasantly surprised to be directed to the 1st class lounge - as we were flying business class.

I was travelling with 2 friends, 2 of us had Priority Passes and we paid £20 for our guest. What a waste of money! As we had several hours to wait at the airport before our flight home to England, we agreed this would be our best option. At the reception area, there was a pleasant young lady who signed us in, but what else she did was anybody's guess! There were 2 lounges - the business class one, we were informed we could pay an additional $16 each for, and they had a selection of sandwiches and wraps, but no guests in the lounge itself. We went into our side, where there were several guests, but no staff. Having stood at the counter for several minutes, it dawned on us it was self serve! Not that there was any signs or anyone to tell us this! Having pulled a couple of beers from the fridge, there was no sign of a bottle opener and when we asked one of the other guests how he had opened his, we were told, with a knife! Doors to the cupboards were hanging off their hinges. There were 2 lots of soup, but goodness knows what was in them, and after we had been there 3 hours, they had not been changed. And there were no bowls to serve them in anyway and there was some sort of saladdy looking thing but I have no idea what. Other guests were also commenting on what a waste of money this all was. Any glasses for drinks or plates used by ourselves and other guests were not cleared away and in the whole time we were there,  we did not see any sort of staff other than in the reception area when we complained.

Jesse Williams Ranch,Ranches,Shelly M,A memorable family adventure!,"My husband and I took our two kids, ages 2 and 5, for a tour and up close view of the animals.  We had a wonderful guide named Ashley, who spent 2 hours walking us around introducing us to the animals and sharing their stories.   We met and pet a 7 month old zebra, donkey, and miniature pony.  We viewed an alligator, panther, and several monkeys.  My kids not only got to ride horses for the first time, but participated in feeding, brushing, and tacking.  It was life-changing and incredibly ten minutes down the road from where we were staying.  I'm thrilled my children had such a special first riding experience.  They definitely gained a strong appreciation of animals after spending much of the year living in the city.  Jesse was enthusiastic and extremely welcoming.",50,December 2015

Wings Over Miami Air Museum,"Military Museums, Specialty Museums",Walter W,Not Much To See,"With the exception of one plane which was undergoing maintenance outside(a Catalina Flying Boat), the entire exhibit, which numbers perhaps a dozen planes, is housed inside a single, un air conditioned hanger. The planes are typically privately owned and the array constantly changes as planes are added or removed. It is an eclectic mix of private and military planes but in no case can you get up close and personal with any of them. Overall, I would rate the exhibit as disappointing with the highlight being able to speak with a veteran of both Korea and Vietnam who flew 100 missions over North Vietnam in a electronics countermeasures aircraft.",30,August 2014

My kids are 10 and 12yrs and they really enjoyed it. The place just need some TLC. If some money is put on to it; this place will shine like a gems. We did not see Thomas Train (it was not out) but from far seem very accurate. The inside of the trains were really cool, it takes you back in time, BUT some of the wagons are really dirty. I understand that they run on volunteers but the dirt is a day by day cleaning that can be done. It would be nice if they have a Tour guide but it was also fun to walk around freely. They truly need to just get their hand on and more people will come. Also the need to make the entrance more noticeable, we almost missed it and get a good website the one online doesn’t work.

Wings Over Miami Air Museum,"Military Museums, Specialty Museums",RachNorfolk,Interesting Air Museum that honours military and civilian aviation,We then went outdoors and looked at the large black plane. It was a seaplane which needed restoring. We spent about 1 hour and 15 minutes looking round the museum and really enjoyed it. Thought the entrance fee was sensible. As you exit you go back through the gift shop which has rest rooms which we used. When we were at the museum we were the only visitors there which was quite a surprise. Maybe because it was January and most people had gone back to work. I am glad I went here as it was very interesting. As we were leaving we saw the men pulling a plane outdoors that they were going to fly that day. I think this place is more for adults as kids may get abit bored after a while. If you are into flying and planes and the history of planes you will love it all. I am not that into it but I really enjoyed it( hubby is more into planes etc than me). Well worth going to . They also hold events during the year that maybe worth going to.,40,January 2012

We went in only to find there were only a handful of stores actually still operating...The majority of the stores had either moved or closed up shop. I'm sure at one point this place was the place to shop well not the case anymore. We decided to leave after walking around for about 45 minutes as there wasn't much else to see. On the way out the parking attendant says that will be $8 for parking! Are you kidding me? I was here less then an hour.....she says no Saturday and Sunday they charge a flat rate even if your there for ten minutes!...It's ridiculous no wonder this place has gone down hill!

Since the first day while driving my car to destination I was enjoying so much what I was seeing, and  every time I go I feel the same, I love to go there. It is true , the beauty of little Haiti is not at its architecture, it is in the good energy you feel.  I watch the kids going to school accompanied by their mothers, I watch the old ladies walking the streets wearing the head wrap, I see women and men going to work carrying a plastic bag with their lunch, I see the bakery selling Haitian bread, the small family restaurants, I feel their culture,  I find beauty from all that . This area is not the most beautiful area in Miami, but there live one of the most ,sweet, hardworking and polite people I have ever known since I move to Miami.

However, this was the second year riding the Polar Express and I have to say I was disappointed.  The windows on the train were so fogged up or dirty that you could not see out. We had pointed that out to the person in charge on our car before we left.  The sound system was so bad that we could not hear the story being told.  We sat on the right side of the train, so for the 5 min that we stopped at the north pole, we could not see anything because the persons in charge kept yelling at us to sit down!  The windows should be clear, the sound system efficient and the one and only area that is set up to view should be on both sides of the train!!!

The Kampong,Gardens,ACW2243,So Worth Your Time - but Maybe Not for Everyone,"During our first visit to the area we took in the Fairchild gardens so we were very pleased to find Kampong, the Fairchilds' home. We called and found that no one was scheduled to be there that day so we arrived, we  buzzed in at the gate and met at the house by the Director. She showed us around and gave us a 15 minute history and over view of the place. She gave us a map and then turned us loose to explore on our own. It is an amazing place, a testament to an amazing man. Things to consider - it is not a large place and most of it is a natural garden (not a formal one) of Fairchild's plantings. There is a lawn that sweeps down to the bay. The house itself is small but incredibly interesting. If you go during the summer take bug spray, water, and sun screen - the heat and humidity can be brutal. I though it was fascinating but it is not for everyone. You have to call in advance to make a reservation to see it. There are guided tours and self-guided tours. The cost for the self guided tours is $15 per adult. ",50,August 2015
Casino Miami,Casinos,mwooduk,Great concert venue,We do not gamble so I am reviewing this casino purely on the concert/entertainment venue portion.  We attended the Dennis De Young/Music of Styx concert on June 21st and had a good experience.  The location is not in the greatest part of town but still safe.  Parking was plentiful and there is also valet parking.  We had purchased tickets in a section that gave us better seating near the front and meet and greet options with Dennis and the band after the show.  The casino also offered free tickets/general admission for seats at the back but even they were great seats and I think we would happily sit back there too in the future.  We thought the sound was very good and the chairs were padded and comfortable.  Staff were excellent (especially Angel who was fabulous) and the security guards were very good with a few drunk people who got out of control and handled the situation well.  Drinks at the bar were affordable (although the wine was low quality) and they have hostesses who will take your drink order from your seats.  It reminded me of being on a cruise ship!  We did have to wait one hour after the show to meet Dennis which was quite a long time to wait since the concert ended at 11 p.m. but his show was so good and his voice so great still (at the age of 67) we were happy to wait to thank him for a great show.  We will definitely return to see America in November.,40,June 2014
Casino Miami,Casinos,mwooduk,Excellent Concert - America!,"My husband and I came here on Saturday night to see the band America.  We had never seen them before.  We got a Groupon - 2 tickets for $18.50 - what a bargain!  When we arrived, parking was very busy one hour before the concert but we managed to find a space (valet always has too long of a line).  You have to take your Groupon paperwork to the Will Call area to swap it out for a ticket - then your ticket allows you to sit anywhere in a certain section.  The concert started about 10 minutes late.  The band was fantastic!  So glad we went.  A little tip for visitors - the bar/waitress service inside the concert venue charges far higher drink prices.  If you go out again by the entrance to the concert facility, you can get the same glass of wine for $2.50!  They also sell food just outside for less money.

Casino Miami,Casinos,MrMiamiExplorer,Just OK,"Casino Miami, formerly known as Miami Jai Alai has been around for decades. Since it expanded to become a casino, I haven't seen Jai Alai in session even once. I wonder if they discontinued it completely? You will get free play with a new player's club account. You may drive right by the entrance road to this casino as there is no noticeable signage and it is surrounded by warehouses, industrial factories, and low income crime ridden neighborhoods. The casino itself is probably the ugliest one in Miami and resembles a large warehouse from the exterior itself, with little concern for landscaping the exterior. Surprisingly it is always packed with gamblers despite the fact that the area is not known for people with income to burn. If it is pouring rain you will get soaked (unless you valet) as there is no covered garage parking, but rather 1 big open lot which floods up to your ankles. Due to the surroundings, there seems to always be at least one police car in the lot. Some of the security guards I have found to be aggressive and unprofessional. This casino is literally down the street from the airport, so anyone with a long layover can kill time and blow money there. Despite the flaws, we will keep returning.",30,November 2014
Casino Miami,Casinos,Herdcyclone,Old School Miami,"I realize 98% of the people don't even know what jai-alai is anymore.  But my son and I had a good time.  Glad I went.  Hey, there is even a brief snippet in the opening credits of the TV show Miami Vice.    I'm sure it is not a big tourist stop anymore.  But to just sit in the building, and imagine the former history and glamour and all that, that was kinda cool.  It has seen its better days, but if you can deal with something a bit rough around the edges, you should carve out some time for a visit.",40,December 2014

Complete with countless plant varieties(well labelled), uniquely designed buildings, and tales of South Florida pioneers (dating back to the 1800s), one can't help but be impressed with this little-known gem. Dr. David Fairchild, one of the more famous residents, contributed his horticultural knowledge to create this tropical paradise. Dr. Eleanor Simmons, an equally notable character, was Miami's first woman physician who often made trips by donkey to Miccosukee tribal lands to help ailing natives. There are so many  stories which could fill this review, but treat yourself instead, to a trip of your own and see what a special place this really is.

They give you $30 in free play when you sign up for a card. We actually won and played all day on their 30 dollars. There are 2 rooms that are smoke free. Decent variety of games in the smoke free rooms. There are many choices in casinos and this was just doesn't stand up to the others.

It's way toooo hot to be outside all day looking trains. Maybe during the winter time it's a little more pleasant since it's not scorching out! Again, all you are doing here is looking at trains, walking inside of them and for 12 bucks you can even ride one. To me it wasn't a pleasant trip but maybe for those who like trains? I don't know.

There are two train rides, one on a real train from the 1920's and a minature train ride. My boys loved riding in the caboose, they even got to sit up top where the trainman rode. They even have a train that was used to carry rocket parts for the Space Shuttle. The museum's star attraction is the former United States presidential train car.

Make sure to walk down to the bay and see the view he enjoyed while living here and while planning his many travels for the U.S. dept. of Agriculture. Make reservations and then go enjoy the scenery and the quiet in the midst of the bustling city, and know that you are also supporting local and national history at the same time.

The shops at CocoWalk (and the surrounding area) are different -- not a lot of chain stores.  There is a travel store that is different from most travel stores, there is a cigar store and a great movie theater with premium screens.  The movie chairs are comfy and rock.  We popped in for a matinee and the place was not at all busy -- we had the theater to ourselves (it was basically a private screening - fun!).  We walked around the Coconut Grove stores adjacent to the Cocowalk and found an interesting Olfactory store and some cool/trendy clothing shops and bars/cafes.

The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,Stephanie P,A Day Out with Thomas…A Day of Disaster,"Don't go to this event. I visited the ""Day Out with Thomas"" event on Saturday, March 14, 2015, with my family and was extremely disappointed. I entered the park and was told by the entrance ticket collectors to follow the red line 15 minutes prior to my boarding time in order to board the Thomas train. It is important to note that the only reason for attending this event was for the Thomas train, as the other ""events"" surrounding the train were less than amusing for my toddler. Fifteen minutes prior to my boarding time, I walked the red line and quickly saw approximately 100 people standing in semi-formed lines. I was very perplexed by the lack of order, especially since Thomas employees were sitting, in conductor overalls, without giving any guidance or structure to the formation of the lines. Then, one overall wearing conductor informed us to ""come back in 45 minutes, the train is broken."" We then learned that the train had been broken for some time. My husband and I were both extremely upset that we drove approximately 50 minutes to get to the event, purchased a $20 ticket per person online, and walked through an entrance gate where an employee, whom I later learned knew of the train break down, did not inform us of the break down. We quickly attempted to get a refund for the event. I was not alone, of course. A group of customers, also extremely upset by the lack of notice, attempted to get refunds. The supervisor, whom reluctantly came out to help us was extremely hostile, disrespectful, and dismissive of everyone's complaint. Her name is Liliana; she was in fact hiding in a kiosk after she learned the group of people were upset. We inquired why we were not told that the train was broken. She did not give an answer. We were finally told (40 minutes later) that we needed to go through the online vendor for a refund. I left the event very disappointed. I believe that the event committed fraud and theft. They were accepting money and offering to provide a service that they in fact could not provide. They were lying to each person who bought a ticket. It was disgusting and disgraceful. I know the company who provides this Thomas Day Out service travels. Please spread the word so that more do not fall victim to their pranks.",10,March 2015

The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,Anthony P,Well worth a visit.,"Visitors to railway museums are probably well aware of the fact that what is on display is frequently in need of care and attention. Many exhibits have probably suffered the deprivations of time, weather, and vandalism for far too long. Repair, renovation, and reconstruction is expensive, so your modest payment to view what is available will naturally help preserve what is here. Viewing is a pleasant walk with helpful staff to provide answers to questions. What you will see will be rather special, but you probably need to have a love for the steam railroad to get the most out of what is on show. Allow yourself two hours of peaceful viewing.",40,April 2015

Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,TheArmasFamily,Good experience. Kids loved their playground ,"We visited back on 2003 but came back this summer with our parents so they can experience a casino for the first time. They have child care service for $10 2 hours and the kids loved. They have one of those multiple stories playgrounds maze and they had a blast. They didn't want to leave. They offer you $30 if it's your first time to play all in one easy machine. My mom won $120 out of those free $30. My husband won too but he spent it all afterwards but I least I didn't feel like I lost our money. Is a smokers paradise, I didn't like it because I don't smoke but they have an in close non smoking area that is great. You get free drinks while you are playing. They are free so don't expect great quality and it takes a while to get them. We went to the 2 ND floor afterwards for the buffet and it was good. Not a humongous selection buy food was eat able and international so everyone enjoy it. ",50,August 2015
Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,Mike B,Go somewhere else,"This place has slots, that is the pro. As for the cons, you will experience why Miami is considered the rudest city on the planet. This place is filled with third world trash who don't speak a word of English, and who are blatantly rude. Had some guy sit next to me and started hitting the buttons on my machine. Had to get someone to get him away from me because he started following me around. He couldn't understand what he was doing wrong. That is the mentality there... As for the slots, they advertise the highest payouts and most paid out jackpots in South Florida. Lies. Miccosukee is the only casino where I never left ahead, also never saw anyone win a hand pay. Most visits, slots are dead cold. When they are paying which is rare, you will stay afloat, but lose. Lastly, stay away from their 2 cent quick hit machines, they are rigged to not pay anything.",10,August 2015
Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,MrMiamiExplorer,Positives and Negatives,"I had not visited this casino in a long time, so we made a detour on the way home from Everglades Safari Park. First the positives: As it was a weekday afternoon, parking was not a problem. As I had not signed up for a Player's Club Card in the past, I decided to get one. It came with $30.00 of free play, which is nice considering some local casinos don't give any. Though I didn't win big, I still walked away with $23.00 of free cash in my pocket I won with the original $30.00 credit. This more than paid for our gas to trek up to the Glades. Now for the negatives: the road construction on the Tamiami Trail to get to the casino was a pain. If you listen in the parking lot, you can hear firing from the gun range across the street, which makes me concerned about stray bullets. The slot machines are not Vegas style, but are rather computer arcade screens which simulate the real thing, and are much easier to program not to pay out. As always, the casino is filled with foul cigarette smoke which saturates our clothes and hair. Rather than circulating around the casino like most places, security guards are just posted to stand all over the exterior of the casino gaming floor. Strangely many of the security guards are Hispanic senior citizens with not a single Native American to be found. The tall sign on the Tamiami trail, which can be seen for miles still advertises the $9.95 steak and lobster, but I can tell you from unfortunate experience that the steak and lobster are both so small, they are practically appetizers. After walking all over the casino floor looking for a restroom we finally found what appeared to be the only one, which was closed for construction. We smelled urine in the parking lot earlier which was now obvious. Even the Players Club counter was closed with a sign directing us to a temporary table in the hotel lobby where a rude and unfriendly woman was handling it. The casino is surrounded by the picturesque natural beauty of Everglades Sawgrass habitats, but sadly not for long. The West side of the property was filled with trucks and bulldozers that already had begun digging up and destroying the surrounding natural habitats, possibly to mine for limestone rock. It's a shame that the Miccosukees apparently now care more about money & profits than the environment their ancestors called home.",30,August 2015
Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,Eden H,Nice pit stop on the way to the Everglades,We didn't spend long here but it was clean and easy to maneuver. A lot of the same basic slot machines but there was a good crowd.,40,May 2015
Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,jackyw943,Nice place for one night,"We had dinner in the fine dining restaurant which was nice and good value for money! It had a lovely atmosphere but a bit inflexible with the menu ! I had fish which came with vegetables and rice but asked if I could have a salad from the menu with it instead and that was a bit too much for them and not possible! Maybe that sounds fussy but I didn't think it was an outrageous request! We then went downstairs to the casino for a bit of gambling that was fun but not once did a waitress come and ask us what we would like to drink! Probably because we were not playing at the high end machines! We came back to the room stinking of smoke ! The breakfast buffet is cheap $7 per person and that is what the food is like! An ok selection but not very nice my scrambled eggs were cold, coffee only filtered and Luke warm! And even though we had spent all evening in the casino and ate in the fine dining restaurant the night before we were not allowed in the breakfast buffet area with just our room key ! We had to go back upstairs to get out passport ! Overall it was ok and very close to the Everglades safari park but would not stay there longer than one night it did suit our needs for one night only though!",30,May 2015

Each year they do a great job and it is by far the most affordable event as we also attended the other one near Tampa this year.  We may only have one or two more years worth in us before the kids out grow it, but it is a big highlight to them.

It was a pleasure to go through the president's train used by 4 presidents begin with Roosevelt. The train is registered as a national historic landmark. There was a separate fee for this tour (a couple of dollars only) and we learned it is because kids had vandalized the train when it was open without supervision before.  What a shame! There were several other trains to explore.  It was wonderful to imagine what travel was like in bygone eras.  Right before we left a private party began arriving in 1940s attire.  It really made us feel like we had just gone back in time.  The museum is without a doubt underfunded but was still a joy to visit.  Don't miss the lighter than air display about when the land was used for a Naval air station, truly fascinating.",40,May 2013

There are bars, a few indoor and outdoor restaurants, an upstairs movie theater and shops. Nothing very impressive. A foreign tourist who has never been to Miami may enjoy it though. If you visit, don't wander too far West off the property, or you will soon be in the worst, crime ridden part of the Grove.

We never go to the Cheesecake Factory but unfortunately it's there too. Everything from tacos from a hole in the wall to upscale seafood. Yes parking is a hassle, but there are both off street lots and ramps. We usually park for around $5. The area frequently has some funky event going on, parades, art shows, chocolate festivals, so check before you try to drive into the area. The housing neighborhood in Coconut Grove is a real neighborhood with people walking, biking, pushing strollers. The housing market is everything from old bungalows to mega mansions, much of it not visible due to heavy tropical foliage. There is a rough area on Grand, so beware of where you are driving.  The Fairchild Tropical Botanical Center is nearby and 83 acres of beauty. We love to just drive around and people watch.",40,December 2014

Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,Culture2846,Awful Experience ,Came for dinner and playing slots. First negative the parking lot was almost completely closed so people are forced to pay $7.00 to valet park. Went to the buffet paid $21.00 for an average experience. Took a $100 bill and put it in a slot machine with the intention of gambling $40 and leaving. When I had $61.37 left got up to leave put the money in a machine to change the ticket for cash.  The machine turned out of service and I did not get my ticket back or my cash. I had to tell several people and waited 40 minutes for someone to come and get me ticket. This place is disorganized and appears to be run by a crew of incompetent and inept people. Save yourself some grief and go somewhere else.,10,December 2016

The attraction is staffed by volunteers and there did not seem to be any around that day therefore there was not much access to the interior of the equipment and the cars that were open did not have any interior lighting making it impossible to see any detail.  The gift shop was interesting but two dollar post cards and limited selection made for a short visit.  The equipment needs better explanation so you know what you are looking at.  The only car with an explanation is the former FDR rail car used during his presidency.  It was interesting but it lacks detail.,40,November 2016

The ranch looked so welcoming with kids riding horses that I decided to drive in so that my 2-year old could get a better look at the horses.  I was greeted by the owner and several other children and trainers.  Everyone was so kind and even though I didn't know much about horses they were willing to give us a ""grand tour"" of the ranch where my daughter was able to see horses, goats, chickens and more exotic animals such as lemurs, monkeys etc...   It was truly a treat for both me and my daughter and we are heading back there in the next weeks to ride a pony.  This is a great place for all kids in the Miami Westwood Lakes/Kendall/Doral area as well as visitors to Miami.

The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,luvhostels,The Polar Express was magical,"Well, it was magical for little kids but also for me who loves everything Christmas.  The seats are expensive even for coach but it is well worth it seeing the smiles on your child's face.  The trip was an hour long and the ticket does come with some surprises.  If your children are older maybe they won't like it as much.  I think it is perfect for 3-7 years old.  The staff on board keeps us engaged with singing and other surprises (I won't spoil them for you).  When it is time to board, they will board bigger parties first so they make sure your group can sit together.  I do like this system.  The only downside is the traffic getting there is so bad.  So plan ahead and allow yourself enough travel time. It was truly magical.  It is worth doing this at least once with your child.",50,December 2016
The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,janetE3543FP,Polar Express 2016,We took the grandchildren ages 8 and 3 to the Polar Express on Saturday evening at 6 p.m.  It was a wonderful experience.  My hat is off to the staff and performers on the train.  Everyone had a great time.  There were entire families who arrived in matching pajamas.  Our grandchildren wore their pajamas and this adds to the experience. Riding the vintage train was a fun experience.  We opted for the passenger car rather than the dining car.  Four people or more if you have small children can sit together on padded bench seats that face each other.  The train basically goes back and forth on the track so you do have the sensation of being on a moving train and the kids don't realize that they're not traveling a distance.  Take a lot of pictures with your phone or camera.  You can buy the photos the photographer on the train produces but be prepared for a long line after the ride and they're pricey.  This is a great holiday adventure for little kids and families that can be repeated each year.,50,December 2016

I booked these tickets a little less than a month ago and the vendor will only mail them to your home address... my tickets never arrived... I emailed the museum no response, however the vendor did have my tickets at ""will call"".  There were no lines which is a plus but I guess to be honest I expected more? It seemed a bit unorganized, was expecting more of the theme from the city of Soutar or to see Sir Topem Hat AT LEAST... The Thomas they built was very creative and realistic almost scary with the moving eyes but it looked good, the downside was it looked like they slapped it onto an old train and took folks out a couple of feet and put it in reverse back to the station. The train was filthy, the windows look as if they hadn't been cleaned since 1972. I'm a New York native and am no stranger to public transportation and to be honest I've probably rode on cleaner trains during my commutes back home all my life than the fifteen minutes of being on this train. I was disappointed with the cardboard city scene or whatever on the left ... overall, I felt it could have been much better. Maybe in other places it's different but I was not very happy.

Barbara our guide spouted with historical and current information about Dr. Fairchild and what he's done for American Horticulture, particularly in the tropical fruit areas. I was so impressed that I joined their organization and for a new member gift I chose an exotic Peanut Butter Nut Tree. This tree comes from S. American and has fruit the size of quail eggs and when ripe taste like peanut butter. I kid you not.  The little sprout is my tree and the large green bushy tree next to it is adult sized.

The Kampong,Gardens,leila1011,An insight into Dr Fairchild's house,"My husband and I visited during the 2016 Junior League of Miami Showhouse event, when the house was decorated by various up and coming designers. The property is charming and restful, and it felt as if the original owners (for there was another after Dr Fairchild) still lived there. It felt strange visiting a property named ""The Kampong"" as in my mother language, Malay, it means village and if one says ""balik kampong"" it means ""to return home"". I think Dr Fairchild chose this name to reflect how he felt about coming home to roost in this oasis.",50,May 2016
The Kampong,Gardens,ChristywithaY,Peaceful ,"To be honest, the house was underwhelming.  But you pay to see the garden and the beautiful view of Key Biscayne from the overlook. There are trees planted from all over the world. Dr. Fairchild has dozens of varieties of mango trees. If you can, pack your lunch and a blanket to enjoy the gardens. There was a couple on our visit there that did just that. There was only five people when we were there so it made for a nice quiet and relaxing visit. ",40,May 2016

I have to admit it was interesting to see as it is so different to anything else (or from hat you expect Miami to be), but we weren't comfortable stopping there... Lots of garbage everywhere, on the streets in front gardens, shops had very heavy security fences.... its just very different, but still interesting to see.",40,June 2014

The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,Osgales,Polar Express Event during Christmas Holiday..A MUST!,"We took the Polar Express during the Christmas Holiday and my kids loved it.  It is a good experience that you should take them to while they still believe in the white bearded guy.  We paid to have the chocolates and cookis and to seat in our own table which is a little pricier but it was worth my kids face.  It is good mentioning that you can wear your PJs (adults and kids) if you go to this event. It recreates the Polar Express movie acted by Tom Hanks. I played the movie for my kids a couple of days before so they would have the story fresh in their minds. At the train they sang the same songs and were dressed and acted the same way so it was a smart thing to do. I never told my kids (8 yr old and 4 yr old) where we were headed so when we enter the station it was very nice to see their faces once they read the ""Polar Express this way"" sign...Worthwhile!.",50,March 2017

Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,antqlamp,Avoid this place!!!,"After a long day of sightseeing, we stopped for the night on our way across southern FL from Miami to Naples because of its location. We thought we'd get a nice bed and a great dinner. However, as soon as we walked in, the cigarette smoke from the casino was overpowering. That should have been our first clue. At dinner, we opted for the buffet because the fine dining restaurant was way over-priced. As it turns out, that was probably a bad decision because the buffet was mediocre at best with old food and a minimal selection. Beyond that, the service was poor and the staff unfriendly. In the end, however, I am happy to say that our room was clean and well appointed.",10,January 2018

The machines were 75% not working.  I finally found a suitable machine.  After an hour, I went to check in.  An agent came from around the desk and asked for my ID.  He went back, made a copy and handed it to me.  What happens to my ID after I check out, I thought?  I work in a hotel and I know this is an unusual procedure.  Back to check in, I received an upgrade. Which I thought was generous until I got to my room and realized a Latin Party with music playing that could be heard for miles was across from my room.  No worries, I can settle in the bedroom and watch tv.  The tv in the bedroom would not work.  So, I ordered room service which was quick and the attendant was pleasant.  Woke up at 8:45am and thought I would hit the slots before a ride home and the casino was roped off.  Very unfortunate.  I normally have a good experience at this hotel.  The rooms are tired, the machines are tired and parking is limited.  Might consider other hotel options next time.",10,February 2018

Jodi & Jymie gave us a tour of the animals around the ranch. They showed the children how to feed the horses and deer and waited for each child to have a turn. They told them about the different types of animals and what they eat. The kids got to ride a horse named Shalom Aleichem (Shakespeare) with braids. It was LOADS OF FUN!

There is no food sold there but you can bring your lunch and eat by the trains. For $6 you can take a 25 minute train ride in a 1923 caboose or 1926 rail car. $12 gets you to ride the engine.

The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,dionisiod768,Railroad Musuem,Found a Groupon for the museum and tried it out. I was pleasantly surprised by this museum. They have four different trains you could enter and explore. One train is the former presidential rail car. It’s a very relaxed open air museum. They play great tunes to hear as you board and explore. They offer train rides as well. The type of train depends on the day and cost extra to ride. They also have an air conditioned building full of model train sets. It would’ve been great to see them actually work. Within the same building they have Thomas train sets for the kids. Overall good experience for the family. The trains themselves offer historical artifacts and information as well. Not a bad way to spend the afternoon. ,40,October 2017

Drinks you have to pay which waitress are sooo slow and expensive.in poker room you better know Spanish because that’s all they speak at the tables the dealer tried to remind everyone to speak English because there we a few of us that don’t know Spanish and every casino I have been in this country that is a big no no speaking another language at the tables. I would comment saying I should have paid more attention in my Spanish class to play poker here that was some bs. NEVER again will we come here.

Of course, Ive encountered cigarette odors in every casino I've visited. I think they have a great variety of machines, many are brand new, others show their age, but still deliver a gaming experience. I like that there are multiple areas to choose from. They also have Bingo. This is a very busy casino on Saturday and Sunday night's with live music which can be quite loud.

Before when you took a new person they gave them $30.00 to play and you $10.00 now they get 0.05 cents and you get nothing.  Food also more the tripled their price.  Half of the machines do not even work anymore and if your ticket cash out gets stuck you can wait almost 45 minutes for a tech. They have cut more then half of their staff.

We almost kept the door open overnight just to get the cool air in from the hallway and the smell out of our room. The food at the Buffet is ok, maybe. We didn't get sick so that is a bonus. Nothing to write home about, at least the coffee was good. The service at the buffet was good.

I had to call the office from the intercom at the gate for the gate to be opened.  There were a few parking spaces.  Garden (the historic parts are mainly in front of the property) was beautiful  What I saw of the house was very nice.  The view of the Biscayne bay was outstanding.

Just 2 tables with tracks on them and a few trains thrown on them that don’t even work on the type of tracks that are displayed. The train inside is embarrassing.... I almost didn’t take my children in when I saw how filthy and old it was.

Jesse Williams Ranch,Ranches,Wendy R,Great place to take your children.,"I was looking for a place to take my daughter for her seventh birthday.  She loves horses and really wanted to spend her birthday at a place she could ride a horse.  I called the ranch left a message and the owner himself returned my call. He was very informative and friendly. I coordinated a family tour of the ranch and a riding lesson for my Daughter. I took the whole family.  A party of 14.  They showed us around, to see some of the animals like the panther, deer, lemurs, zebra and of course the horses.We fed the horses carrots while they took my daughter to learn how to brush and prepare the horse for her lesson. The trainer that worked with her was great she had my daughter toting and giving the horse commands just a short time into her lesson. The owner  Jesse was very attentive he kept making sure we were enjoying are visit and even gave my daughter a birthday gift ""a Jesse Williams Ranch pink t-shirt"". After the lesson was over we had a picnic.  All in all it was an amazing day I am sure my daughter will never forget.  We hadn't even driven away and she was already asking when we could return for another lesson.  Definitely will be coming back soon!",50,January 2015

Casino Miami,Casinos,ExplorerNancy,Off the beaten path ,We visited more out of curiosity than being a fan. We had never been to a Jai Alai game. The spectators were few.

Casino Miami,Casinos,KarneBH,Would have liked to see them play,We really only went thinking we could see them play.  The casino isn't that exciting.  The tablet games are all electronic.  My husband played them for a little while and ended up breaking even.  The slots robbed me.  :)  The place was clean.  I guess they only play Jai Alai during certain hours on Friday afternoons.  We should have checked into it more before we went.  ,40,September 2016

My favorite was getting to go into David Fairchild's workshop/office was amazing to see all of the original artifacts.  There is a path to the bay as well with stunning views of Key Biscayne and Miami.  We spent a little over two hours there and just enjoyed the peace and serenity there and imagining the past.

The Kampong has many fruit bearing trees and it was great to see them all in their natural state - usually I just see these fruits at the supermarket!  The Kampong is a labor of love and when you go don't miss seeing the old laboratory filled with botany equipment from the early 1900s.  You will enjoy this garden if you are a garden lover.  The Kampong has a mysterious quality because many of the trees and plants are from exotic places far away.  Do not miss this unique spot - there are few like it in the US!",50,March 2017

The service buttons on the machines did not work. After finding a staff member to report it to, I was told we will be right there. After 2 hours of waiting and dealing with extremely rude staff, we had to start yelling to get some service. We discovered that if you do not speak Spanish, you get ignored and are treated very rudely by the casino staff. We will never go there again. The staff are rude and the place should be shut down!

Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Casinos,burntweeniesandwich,"Checked out the buffet, no smoke there","Decided to stop by on the way to the Keys, as the casino is on our back road route around the Miami turnpike nightmare, so thought we would stop in briefly, mostly just to check out the buffet, since buffets in Vegas can be a good deal, in my experience. We arrived right about noon on a Friday in December. The parking lot seemed completely full, as far as we could see, and we were lucky to get a spot near the entrance as someone else was pulling out. First you notice the sign, near the entrance, indicating that the valet service is $7, ouch, guess we were lucky to find a space not far from the door. On entering the building a faint odor of smoke is perceived which grows stronger as one approaches the gaming floor. Take a right up the escalator to the second floor and you arrive at a large bar on the left (no one was there but the bartender), walk to the right and you arrive at the buffet. Looked pretty good to me, fair selection of items, not busy at all considering this was lunch time. I didn't actually eat, since we had very recently enjoyed a large breakfast, but it did look appealing, and the price seemed about right for the offerings. Also I smelled no smoke in the buffet area, this was one of my purposes; to see if one could eat here without the stench of cigarettes interfering with eating, since a lot of people had mentioned cigarette smoke being a problem at the casino on TA. I don't think that would be an issue in the buffet area. I then went back down to the first floor to check out the snack area which is to the left, down the corridor, as you enter, cigarette smoke was strong there. I then went to the deli to look at the menu, smoke was also present here. The dessert display in the counter looked appealing, so I ordered a bread pudding to go. It was kind of expensive, but was a fairly large portion, actually enough for two people to share, and it was pretty good. The entire facility that I observed is attractive, and clean in appearance. Keep in mind this was noon on a Friday, I did not see a lot of people on the gaming floor, so was a bit surprised by the smoke being so prominent. I assume the fact that the gaming floor appearing not very busy means the cars in the lot were representative of the people staying at the hotel doing something else at the time. I wonder what the smoke is like when the game floor is fully occupied! My wife accompanied me up to check out the buffet, but refused to go with me to check out the snack and deli installations, because of the smoke odor. Guess we won't ever be gaming there. As you can see, neither of us are big on cigarette smoke. Having enjoyed gambling in Vegas, I know there are ways to deal with the cigarette smoke, as many places there are fine for free breathing, in spite of people smoking everywhere, but apparently Miccosukee has not employed those advanced air circulation methods. Too bad, it would be fun to stop and do some gambling on the way to and from the Keys, but we still might stop by someday for the buffet.",30,December 2018

Peacock Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,Okay Park,"Peacock Park is one of the few open green spaces you will find in Coconut Grove. There is no admission charge to enter, but as this is the greedy Grove there is no free parking. You will have to pay meters, a pay lot, or a parking garage. This kind of sours the experience knowing that you are paying by the minute as your kids run around. In addition to the the big open baseball and soccer fields, there is a shaded area on the West side with trees, which is a perfect spot for picnicking. Just be careful not to sit or step in dog mess, as dogs are apparently allowed in this park. Wildlife apparently like this green space too, as we saw 2 corn snakes mating at the base of a tree.

It's mostly a gravel road, but as long as you're ok with that, there are some terrific things to see.

"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",Scenic Drives,mattiac997,Wildest natural park I've ever visited - a real taste of the Everglades!!!,"I've been there a few times and have to say I'm always pretty impressed: this is not a typical family visit like those to touristic parks with guides and gated animals, it's wild and real. You see gators diving, swimming and walking all over the place, they cross the road and can get very close (you need to take your time, drive slowly and stop across those bridges, can't just drive through at normal speed if you want to spot them, it's not a theme park). My understanding is that crocodiles, that are much more aggressive, live in the Southern portion of the Everglades towards the Gulf where waters get mixed with the ocean, so this should not be their area. Birds are also very easy to spot - dozens of species - and, most importantly, to hear: you need to remain silent and feel the nature surrounding the road. We've been able to see an eagle catching a fish on the spot, while flying over the river on the side, it was awesome. Easy to see are also turtles, snakes and other species of reptiles - need to be careful & properly equipped if you want to adventure inside through the several trails that are available in different locations (remember, this is the home of the Florida Panther, although they are not easy to spot). I would suggest a whole day there if touring the Everglades, but you'll need to plan it properly & in advance - camping sites are also available. There's a small little ""ghost town"" that reminds me of those horror movies filmed in the countryside. I truly recommend this place to all nature & wildlife lovers!!! But please - keep it clean & natural, it's a real treasure :)",50,July 2018

A. D. Barnes Park,Parks,MrMiamiExplorer,Positives and Negatives,"I had passed by this park for years, but never had time to visit. Now finally I was in the area for an appointment and decided to explore this park. Firstly admission and parking are Free. There is a playground, lake, fishing area, pool, jogging trails, and lots of wide open green space for recreation. Being a wildlife lover I was most interested in seeing the nature trails and Nature Center. Unfortunately that afternoon the nature center was closed but I didn't miss much, as the nature center was basically a tiny shack with a trailer next to it. The nature trails through the preserved pine forest were beautiful with a few exceptions. I did not see much wildlife, with the exception of lizards, and clearly saw the reason why. The forest is completely infested with  stray cats. Every few feet I would encounter another one. These feral felines are gobbling up the native wildlife and destroying this sensitive ecosystem. I would suggest that the park service trap them because in addition to them decimating the native animal population, they are a danger to guests because of the threat of rabies. It is only a matter of time before a child tries to pet a sick one and gets bitten. There was also lots of trash strewn everywhere throughout the forest trails, which had not been maintained. Most disturbing was that there were signs along the trails of Santeria and/or Satanic rituals being performed in the forest, I assume at night. Along the trail in a few different places I saw mutilated chicken carcasses, some partially in plastic bags, which were attracting the stray cats even more. This gave me the creeps! With some improvements, this park could be an even better place.",30,June 2014

There is a call box there to gain access, but we were told by the gentleman who answered our call that there were no touring spots available that afternoon. Since it was well before 3:00 p.m. we thought that was odd. Not sure why one needs to reserve a time to tour a garden, but in any event, we felt this site did not make it easy at all to visit them.

There were a few vendors there, but nothing like advertised in ads. It's a very colorful, run down area. Most businesses were closed. There were only a few places open for business. The people in the area are NOT friendly is you don't speak Creole, even if you're Black. Lower your expectations. Saturday is the best day to go visit. Otherwise, don't waste your time unless there is a special event in the area. Even then, choose wisely.",20,May 2018

The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,hectorfrommiami,We need to save this historic place,"The Museum has a lot to offer, but it needs sponsors and more volunteers to help cleaning and maintaining the place.  If it gets the proper care I am sure it will attract a lot of visitors.  Even in the condition it is, I am going back.  I spent today a couple of hours there and took over 340 photos, but for sure I will be back and I sincerely hope that the place will flourish.",40,March 2019
The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,scott r,Skip it,"Despite some reviews I went prepred to like this, wanting to like this, routing for the underdog.  Well, it's a dog anyway.  You can go through some old carriages; the more intact ones were interesting.  There's an attempt at AV; the best one was almost drowned out by louspeakers playing 'period' music.  Display items often confined to those of interest to serious engineers rather than those curious about railroad travel.  Make no mistake, I'm a big WWII ship fan - I'm not expecting 'restoration' but additional effort at presentation (underscore) would have helped.  There's a presidential rail car on exhibit for another $12, but having spent the basic admission for what amounted to not much I was not in a generous mode.  No one else seemed to avail themselves either.  The model RR (again, a big fan here of a well done layout) was just sad.  I admire the preservationist spirit, but here the whole thing just misses the mark.",20,April 2019
The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,brianinboca,Almost the first Saturday of the month free day,"Do not go if you have to pay. The first Saturday of every month except march is free.  For free it's not bad walking around some of the trains. The presidential car is not open to really go into separate or that they don't tell you you need to take and I did not see available on the website.  Do not I repeat do not take the train ride.  It is billed as a 25 minute ride. It is not. Is a three or four minute ride repeated five times. You go up a little bit literally a little bit it's weeks a lot to put in reverse you go back a little bit it squeaks a lot you go forward again.. the 25-minute ride implied in the website is absolutely misleading. So to reiterate do not pay to go there, and absolutely did not take the train ride to not say I didn't warn you if you don't listen",20,June 2019
The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,Ted Y,Great for rail fans or history lovers!,"I had a few extra hours to spend in the Miami area, so I decided to visit the railroad museum. The railroad has many train cars open to go through so you get an idea of what rail travel was like in the early to mid 1900’s. There are a couple steam locomotives on display as well. The train cars are all parked under a large shed in case it were to be raining you could still visit and enjoy. The highlight is the Ferdinand Magellan, the rail equivalent to Air Force 1. The car is available for tours, so be sure to ask to include that tour as well. A separate building houses several model railroads. Park type train and real train rides are available from time to time, so be sure to ask about them. There is a gift shop.",50,November 2019
The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Specialty Museums,Marshall B,Diamond in the rough - just needs (a lot of) polishing - but essential stop for rail buffs and kids of all ages,"We sort of knew what to expect when we visited - this was not going to be at the Smithsonian level - but to see so much rolling stock (yes, maybe not in the best shape, but this the work of passionate volunteers) does make one thank those visionaries who decided to preserve rather than throw away. There are Interesting exhibits on railroading but also on the function of this site during WWII - and it had nothing to do with trains.  We were not there when any of the trains were functioning - but it is good to see that the museum has such an outreach effort, especially for kids. Seeing such powerful machines up close, and walking in many of them, is bound to put train sets on birthday lists.   But don't go merely to support the volunteers' efforts - the museum is impressive in its own right, but of course it does not hurt to have decent attendance results.",40,January 2019
"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",Scenic Drives,Martin R,A real life wildlife safari on my way from Naples to Miami.,"I had read about this old loop road and how amazing it is with all its flora and fauna, including alligators by the dozen.  So when driving from Naples to Miami instead of taking the I-75 (which I have also read is dead boring despite it being called alligator alley) I took the FL-41 and from here dropped onto the scenic Loop Road, or FL-94 to use its official title.  This road is inside the Big Cypress National Park and is nothing but a compacted dirt track that loops for around 24 miles with cypress swamp on both sides.  If you stop at the little bridges / culverts, of which there are many, you will most likely see alligators.  I must have seen a couple of dozen in total along with various water birds and a large terrapin. The swamp itself is scenic with various lush green plants, air-plants and flowers.  After about 15 miles I did start to think it was all a bit more of the same but you just keep going.  Also the road is not a fast road as it is a dirt track, but fine for a regular rental car in good weather, and so this loop road can take a good hour or more to drive with stops to look at the wildlife.  I attach a map with my review to help you locate the loop road drive, along with photos of what I saw along the way!  Well worth the detour and a far better way to get to Miami if you are not in a hurry than taking the I-75.  Highly recommend this experience.",50,February 2019

"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",Scenic Drives,FraserCambridge,Potential to spot wildlife?,"I have to qualify my review as we only drove a section of the loop road. Our entry point was NOT at Monroe Station, but at the other end where the road is paved for about 7 miles into the loop. It goes past numerous developed dwellings for a couple of miles before it gets to the swamp proper. After about 5 miles of swamp scenery on both sides, although interesting, we turned back. I expect the further you go on the loop the greater the chances of seeing wildlife are, but apart from birds and fish we didn’t see any.",30,November 2018
"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",Scenic Drives,414janalh,So cool day or night!,We went during mating season and it was very windy so the alligators weren’t really out a whole lot during the day. We didn’t see any in our airboat tours and heard this place was a must. We went at dusk/night the first time and brought flash lights. We stopped at all the water ways and could see eyes glowing back at us! A few even swam towards us. It was pretty cool to see. Others were right there at the waters edge. It was a rush! Stay in the car if you go at night because it’s dark and you have zero cell phone service if something happens. It was so cool we went back the next day and it did not disappoint!,50,May 2019

A good selection of 30's and 40's mono and bi-planes including Havard and T6 trainer which were in immaculate condition.  On Static show F14 Tomcat which was great to see up close.  Lucky to speak to the owners of a couple of planes who were very informative and dragged a few aircraft onto the pan for photoshoots as well as running the T6.  A good few hours.  All the staff were friendly and thanks to the guy with the MGB for the tour.  Outside, opposite the museum there is a Cuban memorial with a A26 Invader.

The Kampong,Gardens,etwinschm,"Lovely, yet not overwhelming and a little pricy","First off, visitors should be advised that ideally an appointment is needed to visit this NTBG. Otherwise, you'll spend ten minutes roaming around in the area in an attempt to find the main entrance. Once you'll have found it you'll be busy finding out that you actually have to call somebody using the intercom at the red gate. If you manage to overcome these obstacles you'll be met by a very friendly assistant who hands you a map of the botantical garden and takes the entrance fee from you. I should note that $15 is a little pricy compared to how the botanical garden shapes up in the end. We've been to a number of botanical gardens before - especially to other NTBG branches in Hawai'i - and we must say that this one was a little disappointing. The display of plants and flowers is quite limited (and I'm not talking about them being in bloom - we know that not all flowers can't bloom at the same time in a botanical garden). However, we were left behind with the feeling that $5 of entrance fees would suffice to maintain such a garden.",30,February 2019

I held off on visiting because I wasn't sure how it worked. All you need to do is call during their operating hours and make a reservation. The reservation does not need to be a precise time, it's okay to ball park it but they need to know you are coming. Once you arrive call them on the intercom and they will open the gate. Park and walk up to the house to pay your entrance fee of $15. They will take card or cash. If I came back I would make a point of arriving for a guided tour. You can tour on your own but there is so much to see that I think you will get more out of the visit if you walk with a guide.",50,April 2019

Wings Over Miami Air Museum,"Military Museums, Specialty Museums",Carlos B,Very Nice Air Museum,"The flyer says: ""Wings Over Miami is a unique aviation museum established to honor commercial, military and general aviation history."" The key word is ""unique."" Let me explain why I think this is a very appropriate description. It consists of two parts: a model airplane section containing perhaps 2 or 300 scaled plane models all fully identified with manufacturer and model numbers and properly painted  with country insignias when applicable. They ar mostly displayed in glass cases by type of plane or by country. You should spend some time there before moving on to the second section, a large hanger with a dozen planes. Most planes on display are not only functional, they are are used in air shows and movies around the country. The museum is all indoors so it is great for a rainy day. Allow 1 to 2 hours to view the museum. If you have a group. I highly recommend you request a tour guide in advance. Our tour guide was absolutely wonderful.",50,January 2019

Otherwise, it's impressive that the planes still FLY.  The museum part itself is better appreciated by a hobbyist - models, models, models; and the historical context is light.  There's also a military vingette hallway that I probably could have given more time to - assuming the the videos were playing (am sure one could ask).  With the personal tour, I'd call it 5 stars if you have aviation interest, without either the personal attention or interest on your part, maybe a 3.

The area for the monkey to play is massive, 7 acres for 100 something of them. They are well cared, they seems happy, playful and healthy.

Our 10-year-old love-love-loves monkeys and he was so excited to feed the squirrel monkeys - they climbed up his arm and on his head! Granted, this tour costs more than general admission, but it was so worth it for us. The gift shop was a stuffed monkey lover’s dream, but that’s up to you to tell your kid you’re not buying another monkey unless its his birthday. Also, there’s no restaurant on the premises, just a snack shack, so plan your dietary needs accordingly. Otherwise, for the up close and personal experience of being with the monkeys, it was truly a wonderful afternoon in a tropical environment.",50,December 2018

If I was a dolphin or seal, I would learn to ""perform"" just to break up the monotony living here.  I have been to much nicer aquariums that do not put on ""shows"".  I had my doubts going here, but thought it could be really nice.  We visited on Weds.  There may have been 150 guests in the park.  The grounds have several areas set aside for special events and birthday parties.  The barbecue lunch was wonderful!  I complimented Tre'Von Watson's food.  The barbecue chicken, baked beans and corn bread were hot and the mustard potato salad flavorful and cold.  The chicken quarter was one of the smallest I have ever seen.  So buyer beware.",30,February 2020
Miami Seaquarium,Aquariums,Roger P,"A poor man's Sea World- lots of animals, but....","4 different shows to see, plus a handful of 'talks' about featured animals such as harbor seals, manatees, sea turtles and penguins.  For shows that demonstrate learned behaviors, there were 2 dolphin shows, an Orca show, and a Sea Lion show.  I found the shows poorly produced.  They were trying to emulate a Sea World without the professionalism and polish that Sea World brings to the table.  Bad, too loud music also detracted from the experience.   There are good educational exhibits through out preaching sustainability and protecting the environment.  It's a decent exposure for little ones to see marine mammals in action.  But, for the money, I think you can do better else where.  I rated this facility average, but would shade it towards the 'poor' category.",30,February 2020

It runs by a lake and a neighborhood of great homes, and it runs into an olympic sports park with a track & field running track and a large basketball court. I don't know if you know this, but Tropical Park has a lot of history. At one point, Tropical Park was home to the original Zoo Miami, or formally known as Metro Zoo, until it was closed and wiped out after Hurricane Andrew on 24th, 1992 by the 175mph winds of the storm. Parts of the ruins of the old zoo can still be seen during your bike ride or walks when you visit the park.

This show basically hits ya in the face as soon as you enter. It was sooooooooo disappointing. I am soooooooo disappointing. When it was over...we (and several others around) were like ""wait...is THIS it?"" We were so depressed walking out of the show that, at that point, we believed every awful review we had read on tripadvisor. We actually didn't even want to go to another show and be disappointed again. But, THANKFULLY, I talked by daughter into just trying the sea lion show and it was wonderful. We loved it!!! That renewed our hope in this place and we followed this show with the Skipper/dolphin show and the killer whale. LOVED THEM ALL. Outside of those three shows...there is not an incredible amount of other things. The penguin exhibit is small/not great. The manatee exhibit is small too. We will be back.

Deering Estate,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Specialty Museums, Historic Sites",scott r,"Nature trail, Xmas decor","Visited this several years ago and had a much improved experience this time.  First, I took the nature tour, and our guide was VERY engaging and quite knowlegable about the grounds, history, ecosystem, etc.  He'd be the kind of person I'd want to hire for a day trip through - pick something wild.  Truly committed to flora and fauna, his unforced enthusiasm (almost a calling perhaps) was refreshing.  [His young nephew accompanied us, and the interaction between the two was also just neat to see - the kind of relationship every boy should probably have with an older cousin or such.]  Second, the buildings themselves were much better presented; prviously almost devoid of furnishing, much has been brought back or recreated - the place was recently a decorator showplace and thing have been left there as 'interpretations' - succeeding to a large degree.  You can wander alone first and take time to read the signs and inspect items close up, and later take a guided tour - again, led by a committed, enthusiastic young staffer, who, when encountered later during further wanderings was willnig to stop and engage about construction, furnishings, conservation, etc.  Had not expected to enjoy the afternoon as much, and I was on the fence about spending $14 for a second experience.

Curiously, if one was a guest of Deering and you needed to use a bathroom---one each in the multiple rooms in both houses--you would be in luck. A fixation with lavatories evidently by the Deering family. The Estate is understated compared to Vizcaya nearby, and Deering seemingly meant it to be so.

It is nice to walk around to feed the monkeys in their little pails, but where the real fun is, is the rain forest adventure. Yes it is pricey, but so worth it.

Way overpriced for what you get, and the place is falling apart. We saw many areas of disrepair and tired exhibits. The shows were embarrassing. The Sealion one was the worse. The staff went behind the centrepiece several times, and spent ages before the next scene was carried out. It was sad to see the Manatees in such a small tank. You could hardly see them due to the sea of lettuces on the top!  The Staff seem to be disinterested in their jobs. We saw several in the background looking very bored! The staff in the restaurant were the worst. There is no need for Management to reply to this, just take a walk around your own park, and you will see what I mean.",10,December 2019

The Wharf Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,Ameola9,So much fun for all ages! ,This place is incredible!! So much fun and great for all ages. My husband and I went here on a Sunday just to hang out and had such a fun time. They have 9 bars and a bunch of different food trucks. Definitely get the lobster roll from OG Ceviche abs Seafood. The best part about the day was the music and atmosphere. There were infant babies all the way up to 80 year olds there and literally everyone was enjoying themselves. It’s also pretty cheap for good and drinks are VERY cheap! We will be back! ,50,March 2019

Miami Seaquarium,Aquariums,Lisa S,Fun Anniversary trip!,"Truly amazing experience to be able to hold a 6' green eel and have stingrays swimming all around you.  Very good deal for the money.  Guides were fantastic!  Of course you're given the opportunity to buy 4 pictures, etc. afterward (from a company not affiliated with the seaquarium) which were quite pricey.  My wife stayed behind and shot a video on her cell phone so that worked for us.",50,September 2019

The Wharf Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,DBernard1029,Nice place to hangout,"This was the first time I’d been to the wharf. It is definitely a great place to take pictures and aesthetically pleasing. Right on the water, and covered with turf. It felt like you were in a tropical garden without an urban area. They have a covered area and an open air area with umbrellas and string lights. It has a fun atmosphere. People were dressed up and down, some in bathing suits, but they do have a sign outside that says they can turn you away for not adhering to dress code (subject to their discretion). Plus side is there’s no entry fee. Typical to Miami, the drinks and food are definitely overpriced. Unless I was starving, I probably wouldn’t choose to eat there. This is not to say the food doesn’t look good, because it does, just pricey. If I went there just for food, that’s one thing, but food with drinks would easily be $50 in one trip. I got a beer for $7 and a strawberry mojito for $13. The mojito was very good. Didn’t seem like they skimped on alcohol, but it’s hard to say for sure. They offered the mojitos in a variety of flavors and they came with a piece of sugar cane which was a fun addition. I would definitely go back for a drink or two but this couldn’t be my regular spot or I’d be broke. Downside is you either have to valet for $15 or park somewhere down the street and pay about $3 an hour. ",40,July 2019

Miami Seaquarium,Aquariums,Mónica V,Completely dissapointing..We paid twice ..No help from client office,"Hello. We visited Seaquarium on the 13th August. We tried to pay with a VISA US Bank gift card (80$). After I introduced the personal password to sign the transaction the employee informed me that Gift Card were not allowed so finally we paid with Cash. Unfortunately I didnt keep the ticket for the cash transaction as I was not expecting any problem. The following day we discovered that there were no funds in the VISA gift card as the transaction from Seaquarion was registered. So without our acknowledge we end paying twice. We decided to inform personally on the 14th of August. In the client office a girl attended us, she was not very supportive. She agreed that Gift cards are not trust ID and it didn't make sense they charged us. We showed her the details from the bank with the transaction from Seaquaium on debit side. She informed she could not help us. Initially she was reluctant to talk to her supervisor to discuss how to solve the problem. After some discussion with her we achieved to have her commitment that the supervisor will refund once they access the bank account details. We took with us a guess issue report signed by them, Unfortunately one month after funds are not refund. It is very disaapointing. We lost 2 hours of our Holiday time to solve it, with really no intention to help from their side.",10,August 2019

I love to go on Fridays to enjoy a few beers while sitting next to the sea. But come on, there's like a million places to just do that in Miami! It's true, you can dance, there's an area for that and another one that seems more like a lounge to sit around and relax but under the stars!

Miami Seaquarium,Aquariums,Iluvtraveling2,Always Nice to Visit,"This was my second time visiting here and I enjoyed it as usual.  Disappointed that both times the Whales show was canceled due to bad weather. This is an outdoor aquarium so pack sunscreen,etc.   I was able to catch he dolphin shows which were awesome.  I ended up paying for the meet the dolphin after the Flipper show.  It was $55 and you take 4 pictures with one of the dolphins, however you only get one free.  To me for 2 min $55 is a bit pricey but hey...it was nice to get the experience of being that close to a dolphin.  It looks like you can bring in outside food so that’ll be a good idea if you plan on being there for a long time and have several people in your party.  There are several food options but of course you know what to expect to pay.  There are a good variety of sea animals and you can feed the stingrays at a set time for a small fee. You will also encounter a few wildlife freely walking around.  All in all, I enjoyed it twice and will still return.",50,August 2019

Most of the “large” tanks are pretty small and I felt bad for the animals to be honest.

Forgetting the ethical aspect, this is Very Much an outside aquarium so you will be in the Miami blazing heat all day!!! Not even fans to create som drift/wind.

The energy and vibe of the bar was what we as a group we’re looking for. The highlight of the night was the service we received at the back bar. Hector, who we later found out was the supervisor of the bar, might hands down be the best bar tender I have ever experienced.

Miami Seaquarium,Aquariums,Jlynlouise,Ah-mazing!,"Booked this experience for my animal-obsessed 10 year old on our day off a cruise out of Miami.  She had done a dolphin swim last summer in Jamaica and I thought it would be fun to surprise her with a different animal experience.  Note that there were tons of dolphin excursions offered through our cruise but I preferred to book an animal experience where I knew the establishment also provides marine mammal conservation and education.  My daughter was paired with a team of three trainers: Kristen, Adam and Jamie and it just so happened that she was the only individual booked for that time slot.  The entire experience was so amazing and she grinned from ear to ear the entire time!  She first entered the outdoor exhibit with Adam and was provided a snorkel mask so that she could free swim with the seals.  After she was able to swim and observe their behavior underwater, trainers Kristen and Jamie entered the pool.  They were all so kind, knowledgeable and patient!  My daughter was able to interact, touch, splash fight, dance and hug the seals for approximately 20 minutes.  Kristen spent time showing her all about the seals and made the program not only very fun but informative and educational.  My girl exited the pool and informed me that THIS was what she wanted to do when she grew up! Rating this against our dolphin swim in Jamaica... the seal swim was hands down a superior experience and if we are in Miami again we will be sure to stop by for another animal interaction!  I also would like to mention that I felt my daughter was safe and well watch the entire time she was in the exhibit, the seals have plenty of space that even if they didn’t care to interact they could move away from the participants.",50,August 2019

Miami Seaquarium,Aquariums,kazlynp,Fun experience but expensive photos,"I did the Dolphin Experience with two friends, and thoroughly enjoyed it as I'd not been that close to dolphins before. The trainer, Melissa F., was fantastic and really made the experience. To be clear, the experience is not swimming with dolphins. You wade into the water and sit/stand on a step while the trainer brings the dolphins up to 'shake hands' and so you can give them a kiss, etc. This is all great fun and very accessible, even for those not so confident in the water. What makes this a less than 5-star experience is the whole photo package sale push. Given the cost of this experience, I think the Seaquarium could find it in their hearts to offer one complimentary photo. The photo package was out of our price range, so we relied on another friend taking photos for us. Not as well-staged as the professional ones, but a memory nonetheless.",40,July 2019

The highlight of those was a porcupine that kept reaching out of his cage to touch us, he was so adorable. Then the show is a worker bringing different animals out for everyone to pet or hold including lizard, frog, skunk, snake, etc. afterwards we followed the worker to the sloth cage where we were able to go in and pet their resident sloth.

The spot is popular among locals, and great for visitors as well!  All the locals were friendly, sharing Miami night life hot spots. The food truck options are awesome!  Bring your appetite as your friends for sharing, because if you’re visiting you want to try it all! My friend and I  shared a few dishes (3 to be exact) from Cracked!  We loved it!!!!  Left full and happy!  Strangers kept asking to taste our food, lol...it was all in fun and friendliness :-). There are plenty of drink options and a large bar in the center of the food truck park.  I believe the main bar has TVs to watch the games, I think that’s what I saw, as I didn’t sit in the area.  There are umbrellas and fans to keep you cool.  There are even games perfect for the sober and not-so-sober (ping pong, life size connect4, etc.). The spot is perfect for yacht viewing, and a few yachts docked to jet their passengers off for late night snack and drink, I guess? Anyway, it was nice seeing the yachts.  The locals say yacht watching is awesome during the day.  The music was awesome, a little hip-hop/R&B, old school-new school blend, current hits, not too loud or obnoxious, just right for any music palette.  The Wharf is a perfect start, finish or somewhere in between spot if you’re wanting to experience Miami night-life Thursday-Sunday.  I believe they’re open until 2am... Make this one of your Miami night-life stops!!!! ",50, 
Safari Edventure,Zoos,Katelyn L,Needs to be reported ASAP,"Horrible horrible place- I wish i could give it zero stars. I honestly have no idea why this place has any positive reviews. I assume because it only cost $15 to get in and you can take pictures with animals. I was under the impression that this was a non profit and these animals were being rescued and helped. However, the animals at edventure safari are not being cared for properly AT ALL. Multiple wolves all kept in a small enclosure where they allow huge groups of people (including children) to go in and pet and photograph the WILD animals. The workers clearly are in no way animal experts nor did they know any information about these WILD wolves. One wolf didnt move the whole time and looked very malnourished and sick (they told me “oh hes just old”). The two year old wolf was trying to escape the whole time and deff needs a large space to run around. I wouldnt allow a small dog to be locked in this space much less multiple young wild wolves. Not to mention it is 100 degrees outside and many animals had no shelter. The aligators had no room to swim and all the cages were rusted,old and most covered in webs.Also many animals looked under fed and all had extremely dirty water. Many birds were missing most of their feathers. We didnt even look at all of the animals because after seeing the wolf enclosure I couldn’t bare to see anymore. I have been to other wolf sanctuaries in Florida and they all have acres of land for the animals to rome and live in packs. So i know there are much better places these wolves could go live. I also herd the “worker” saying they bred the wolves with dogs and sell the wolf dogs to people. These people are using these animals to bred and make money and do not care about their wellbeing. Someone needs to rescue these animals from this “rescue” ASAP.",10,July 2019

The Wharf Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,Swimdogboss,Cool spot!!,Stopped here on our boat ride on the Miami River and Key Biscayne.  Enjoyed good drinks and food options.  The downside was that they wanted us to pay $300 to park the boat....a total rip off since NO other boats were currently there.  It was mid-afternoon and we were LOCAL folks.  The food trucks provided a variety of food choices.,30,

Safari Edventure,Zoos,pupsanka,Great place!!!,"We had a private tour for 6, an hour of amazing experience with the nicest guide ever. It felt like we are alone there, didn't meet other people. We got to pet a parrot, a snake, foxes, wolves and a sloth, feed crocodile, small pigs and ostriches. We loved this experience immensely. Greatly recommended, and the place is quite and pleasant, and doesn't charge you this crazy prices I saw in all other petting zoos. It's 55$ per person for a private tour. ",50,April 2019
Safari Edventure,Zoos,DCG28,Awesome Experience,"Ever wanted to pet a sloth, a wolf, a baby raccoon, a possum and a skunk?? Well this it the place for you.  All of the animals here are either rescued, rehabbed or rehomed.  The sloth and wolves were so sweet and well worth the price of admission alone.  There are emus, pigs, donkeys, goats that you can feed as well.  My group spent about 90 minutes here and was able to see everything and do the guided tour.  Make sure you arrive in time for this so you can interact with the sloth and wolves.",40,May 2019

Is not a fancy place and is not the zoo is for endangered species and animals that people take home and when they grow they cant handle them any longer and other wise have to be put down. There was a show at the auditorium that was amazing. The lady was great knowing everything about the little creatures. My granddaughter was so happy to get to see all this animals and touch them. Skunk, alligator, bullfrog,snake, lizard, sloth. Then they take you in to see the wolves and touch them. Pretty friendly except Athena she was not having it. Love the place....",50,October 2019
Safari Edventure,Zoos,veryhopeful2011,Lots of fun,"We really enjoyed visiting this place. All the animals have been rescued or rehomed. We especially enjoyed the presentation given by a knowledgeable volunteer where we could hold or pet a python, tarantula, baby alligator, skunk and more. The one disappointment was that we could only pet the sloth while it slept in a box. Would have liked to hold it as in the pics. But had a good time and will go again.",50,February 2019

Safari Edventure,Zoos,angelogS8561DC,Best wolf interaction ever !!,"Safari Edventure did not disappoint. This was by far the most hands on experience we have ever had and to have that with wolves is incredible. Now, the experience is not a full day activity but for the $15.00 entrance fee (for Florida residents), the very informative interactive animal show (we held a boa, tarantula and alligator, pet a raccoon, sloth and possum) and all the animals that you see during your visit, it is worth every penny.  Also, it is a deserving donation made to a rescue that is helping out some pretty incredible animals.",50,March 2019
Safari Edventure,Zoos,Stephanie C,"Those poor animals, heartbreaking!","My youngest wants to be a vet when he is older so I try to find animal interaction opportunities for him whenever we travel.  He actually chose this activity out of the two I presented him with because of the wolf interaction.  We also got to hold a small alligator and a very large python during this visit which was pretty cool.  The animal interactions is what really attracts people to this place.  I will say that the guy who did the education piece was great!  However, the conditions are deplorable!  My heart broke for these poor animals kept in cages, some of which seemed to be falling apart.  As another reviewer stated, we also thought we had arrived to someone’s back yard with overgrown vegetation.  This place really just needs to be shut down.  I understand some amount of damage was done by a previous hurricane, but not likely enough to cause the conditions I witnessed today.",20,March 2019
Safari Edventure,Zoos,Nikki H,ITS Tour with Carlos,"This was an amazing experience. We did the ITS tour with Carlos and it was worth every penny. Carlos was a wonderful guide. His love for the animals was heartwarming. You could see how much the animals  cared for him as well. I know this isn’t as modern as a typical zoo, but the intimacy and one on one interaction you get here is so much better. My husband and I fed foxes, lemurs, an alligator, emus, baby pigs, got to play with wolves, feed porcupines (insanely cute) and have up close time with the sloth (amazing life long dream). Carlos was super informative about everything and never made us feel rushed. After our tour we went the demonstration in the little amphitheater and we held a tarantula, baby gator, huge snake, petted and skunk and an opossum. The gentleman who did the presentation was smart and funny and we really had a great time doing that as well. Please don’t judge this place because if it’s out of the way location and somewhat ramshackle grounds. If it doesn’t smell prefect everywhere, remember there are animals EVERYWHERE and only a handful of people to get everything done. Instead of complaining about the appearance, donate to help them rebuild enclosures and continue to do the amazing work they do. I definitely recommend this experience for everyone. We will definitely be coming back with our family. ** ask for Carlos and tell him we said hi! ",50,April 2019

We went to watch an animal presentation at the amphitheater and Pedro did an awesome job at informing everyone about the animals he brought out. He gave everyone the opportunity to either pet or hold the animals. He brought out a skunk, alligator, chinchilla, possum, tarantula, snake, and my personal favorite, the SLOTH!!!

Safari Edventure,Zoos,mangoes1,Takes Hands-On to a New Level,"Most Florida ""encounter"" animal attractions charge beaucoup bucks for the ""experience"" but not here. You can pet all sorts of critters and being a rescue place, the cast is always changing. Don't expect Disney or Metrozoo tidiness. This place is rustic going on rickety, but therein lies its charm. Our group, which included four grandkids ages 6 to 9, enjoyed the intimate setting in which surprises were to be found around every bend on winding dirt paths. When I saw a rabbit cage open and empty and caught a glimpse of a bunny hopping around in the woods, I felt the urge to tell someone before concluding that no one is probably the least bit concerned. I asked the lady up front how long Safari Edventure had been open and she said seven years. Judging from the ramshackle ambience to include an abandoned car with the hood open, I wouldn't have been surprised if she had said 60 years. We've lived in Miami since 1974 and heard of this place only recently. Come on a weekday or non-holiday weekend as our son did on a previous visit, when there were just six other people at the formal presentation part, for the greatest intimacy.",50,January 2019

I was very concerned that I would be among the few that were 'disturbed'. As you can see from my '5' star (or circle) rating I was not. This is not a zoo. This is a rescue facility. This is many of the animals last stop. Without this place, they would be nowhere. I know this because my husband and I paid for the private tour $55 per person. It was amazing. I got to care for the animals and learn where they came from. The care taker that guided us truly loves them. Almost all the animals there were pets of people that were not properly licensed or decided they didn't want wild animals as pets any longer...duh. Poor decision in the first place. This place NEEDS visitors. They need funds, to continue to care for the animals. They want to give them even more. I had a wonderful amazing time. These people love these animals. My husband and I went back two days in a row. Remember this is a rescue facility on someones property. Not a state run zoo.

The horses, donkeys and goats were in a large enclosure that love to be fed. The Sloths and porcupines take food right from your hands. The big hit for my wife were the Wolves. A large male is really big and really sweet. He has other part wolves to keep him company. Whole Foods donate much of the fresh food for the animals. I thought that that was very cool. All in all a delightful experience. Most of the workers were volunteers who cared so much for this place and the animals. Safari Edventure needs donations as well as paying customers to stay viable.

We left upset we had contributed to this ""facility"". The cages, the grounds in general, the fenced in areas for the goats, donkeys, horses, the tanks for the turtles were so badly kept it was disgusting. It looked like a dump which even included an old swimming pool ladder just off to the side. The vegetation, grassy areas were overgrown. The enclosures themselves were the dingiest we have ever seen in any animal care facility. I read a comment from the owner, who responded to another visitor's post about how upset they were with the conditions, that this facility passes inspection from various agencies, and I find that hard to swallow.  We immediately wanted to start cleaning up habitats and  the grounds in general which would require a huge dumpster. It was hard to shake off that experience knowing those animals don't have the option to leave and find shelter in a much healthier, cleaner environment.

It became one of the highlights of my life very quickly, as upon entering my wife and I discovered that the individuals staffing the museum were actually Cubans (now Americans) who lived in and were attached in someway to the actual Bay of Pigs Invasion - it was even more meaningful and emotional when these individuals discovered that at age 18, I was an active participant in that failed invasion as I was aboard one of the 2 Navy destroyers that led and escorted the invasion force.",50,February 2015

Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,drs845,Possibly the worst thing I've ever experienced,"If this review prevents even one person from spending their hard earned money on this complete scam of an event, then I'll consider it worth it. The way that this thing is promoted, you would think that it is the most spectacular Christmas display you'd ever see- and don't get me wrong, the website fooled me too! Walking in, you're greeted by Christmas music that sounds like it's played over a cheap bluetooth speaker, which you can't hear once you walk 20 feet away from the entrance. After walking for about 5 minutes through the light and strange Christmas-themed displays, any semblance of Christmas goes away and this ""enchanted forest"" becomes a typical county-style fair with rides (some of which are NOT included in the admission price, as the website claims) and over-aggressive game attendants that is nowhere near the $30+ price of admission. Quite frankly, there are shopping malls that have more Christmas themes than this place. Stay away and rent a Christmas movie at home instead.",10,November 2018

They had an interactive show with knowledgeable staff that provided great information about the animals with some humor. Great interaction and my son was able to touch some animals and to take pics. Most of the facility was in good condition although some areas could have been maintained for the animals a bit better. But this is more like a sanctuary that survives on donations. It always makes me sad to see animals in zoos, or other enclosed conditions but sometimes it is the only way they will survive. The wolf interaction was nice and again I would like to see a bigger area for them. I think they did a great job here and the animals seemed to be in good condition. I would recommend",40,July 2017

Entrance is $37 but I had a coupon for $5 off and my daughter got in for free . First of all the food , you have 2 choices FRIED, FRIED , FRIED or old food they can’t sell. The rides, good if you’re an adult but not that many options for little kids. The constant harassment from the carnival games is enough in itself to never make me want to go there again. I hate being persuaded to play those gimmicky games and get a prize worth 25 cents, that’s why they always tell you we’ll guarantee you win something. The bathrooms, very small and of course there’s an attendant outside waiting holding the paper towels hostage until you tip him , if I want to experience that I would just go to any club in Miami . Face painting $8 ?!?! Worst part of all is paying $20 to take a picture with “santa”, I’m already down about $75 .

We were not familiar with most of the work so the written handouts on each of the 3 floors were extremely helpful.  Also, a staff member made herself available to escort us and talk about the artists and their work and how they related each to the other.  There wasn't a weak piece in the bunch.  I'd say the museum is doable in about 2 hours if your stroll, think and talk about the work.  Much less time for a run through.  Located in the Miami Art District, it's easy to get to.

Safari Edventure,Zoos,rdh1978,Wonderful attraction dedicated to helping animals,"I visited Safari Edventure today and was overly impressed! Let me start by saying, we did not have reservations for a private tour because it didn't seem necessary from the website.  However, when we arrived, we quickly realized that during this time of school vacation it would have been best.  The private tours were sold out.  However, I watched the entire team here scramble to make sure they accomodated everyone  possible that wanted a tour after the sell out!  That included my husband and I and we were so grateful! I read through all the negative reviews and all I can say is that people who do not believe in zoos will always have something to say.  I, however, see things differently.  I too asked where many of the animals came from and the response most often given was that someone ignorantly adopted the animal without a permit to do so or without realizing what they were getting into.  Yes, some were obtained from other facilities and others were born there but without facilities like Safari Edventure, the formerly mentioned animals may have no choice but to be put down by the state!  I am an avid animal lover and I thought these animals seemed very well cared for.  They seemed to enjoy the attention and love they get from the staff, looked healthy and well maintained.  We were able to pet wolves, foxes, feed alligators, porcupines, baby pigs and emus as well as hold an exotic bird and a sloth! The staff seemed to really love the animals and were well informed to educate us about all the animals on premise. The presentation given was wonderful and it even gave those who didn't want a private tour the opportunity to pet and hold different animals as well as obtain photos.  I have had many opportunities to visit zoos/aquariums for personal encounters and I thought this was very well done.  The fact that they are non-profit and trying to help animals in need makes me feel happy not sad like some of the other reviewers on this site.",50,January 2017
Safari Edventure,Zoos,Louise T,Good experience overall but alarmingly small cages,"However, I came away alarmed at the small sizes of many of the cages -  the cockatoos and macaws being possibly the worst - in ornamental, oval cages that were barely larger than themselves.  There were other animals (eg rabbits) who were just about able to lay down but not move around otherwise - certainly not hop or run.  And the wolves' enclosure is also pretty restrictive for such large animals.  It marred the experience and seems to contradict their whole ethos.  The cages may conform to standards (?) but I found it distressing to see such beautiful animals in such restrictive confinement.",30,January 2017
Safari Edventure,Zoos,Tom42532,Fun Animal Encounters,"We visited based on the high ratings from Trip Advisor and were not disappointed! They have an interesting collection of mammals, reptiles and birds. The base cost is very reasonable (special tours are quite a bit extra) and the base price includes opportunities to hold or pet a number of animals. The place is relatively small and can be done in an hour if you are in a hurry, but their animal show takes over an hour - and is worth the time. The only reason for a 4 rating instead of a 5: a number of the enclosures are old and small and the animals cannot be very happy in them.",40,December 2016

J. Wakefield Brewing,Breweries,FlStines,YUM,"We love our beer, and we thought we would just casually stop by J Wakefield on our way to the Keys... Well, several hours later... Delicious beers, outstanding beer-tenders! A lot of breweries have craft beer guys behind the bar that act like craft beer guys that are being bothered by you. Roley and Alex exceeded expectations! They helped us find the beers we both loved, answered our numerous questions, directed us to the cans and growlers we needed to take with us, and seemed like people we genuinely wanted to be friends with.

Safari Edventure,Zoos,767amyd,Wonderful Day!,"Amazing few hours with my family of 6 (my parents, my kids - 10 & 12, and my hubby).  I booked the ""behind the scenes"" tour and would do it again in a heartbeat. Our guides were knowledgeable and friendly. Getting to experience the animals up close and personal with just the 6 of us is something my children will always remember. We held a sloth, fed the gators, spent private time in the wolf den and with the bat eared foxes, just to name a few. I suggest arriving before your tour to do the general hands on presentation.  Very impressed with our visit and would highly recommend to anyone. ",50,December 2016
Safari Edventure,Zoos,Lucky L,Best place ever for animal lovers,You get a much more personal experience and the staff is super knowledgeable and friendly.

Safari Edventure,Zoos,NatFras777,"Visitor from Toronto, Canada 😊","My experience at Safari Edventure greatly surpassed any expectations I had of the visit. I highly recommend purchasing the VIP pass. Holding and feeding the baby sloth Myrlyn is an experience I will never ever forget! With this pass, we were also able to pet wolves, feed alligators, foxes, piglets and various farm animals. The staff were beyond kind and well-informed to any questions posed. The visit ended with a show allowing us to pet, and most importantly learn about, many other animals - a baby alligator, a chinchilla, a possum, a kangaroo, etc. It was an incredibly fun and privileged day to spend quality time with such amazing animals. I would absolutely return for a visit the next time I'm down south. Thank you to the staff who clearly love their job. ",50,December 2016

Its a little pricey, but once your in all the rides are included.  If you want to go more than once just but the yearly pass.  Lots of little food spots and the usual carnival fair.

With this being said I'm sure the rest of the park would have been spectacular.  I got to the admission booth and it was an honor system. Take an envelope and put $2 in it.  I only had $20s so I left.,30,April 2016

I do appreciate some of the shows they have, but very difficult to see them.  If they had seating with better viewing it would make a huge difference.

There are large crowds.",30,December 2015

Safari Edventure,Zoos,Todd B,Great little hidden treasure of South Florida ,"I've lived in South Florida for over 40 years and never knew about this little treasure. My in laws took us just recently and let me tell you. I felt like a little kid again. It's not a huge place, but it's a great place for up close interaction with wild animals. I had so much fun I forgot to take pictures. The two things I enjoyed the most was being able to actually get into a cage with 3 full breed wolves and it that was free to do. Being able to get that close and pet them was something that made me feel like a kid again. I've always loved wolves for some reason and there I was in there with 3 of them petting them. And also all of the other wonderful animals you can interact with. ",50,November 2016

Safari Edventure,Zoos,amyourantenna,Absolutely Amazing,"This place exceeded our expectations. We were able to pet wolves, sloths, foxes, and all sorts of other animals without doing the tour. Overall with the sloth ticket it was 20 dollars for the day and we spent a lot of time there. It was not crowded, and while I wish the animals had a bit more room, I understand all of these animals are there because they were rescued or have no where to go. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable. They really seem to love the animals and that matters a lot in a non-profit organization. I will definitely go back. This place is great for all ages.",50,November 2016
Safari Edventure,Zoos,ribsb,Great!,"We really had a great time here. The show was really educational and fun. Pedro let you hold a spider, snake, alligator, and let you touch and pet many other wonderful animals. For an extra 5 bucks you can hold a baby sloth which is completely worth it. The wolves are incredible, the other animals on property are incredible, everything here is incredible. The sign out front is a little small and you park right off the street so don't look for a large parking lot area. It really is a great place to visit for a low cost.",50,November 2016

J. Wakefield Brewing,Breweries,559jas,A Beer Experience,"I love the decor of this place. The first thing you see is a mural of Vader on the wall at the entrance of the establishment. I grew up with Star Wars so it definitely was a draw for me. There is more Star Wars art and fun inside but also for the comic book fan you'll find some comic book heroes decor inside as well. They have a nice selection of beer on draft. 24th Street Brown is my favorite. But if you feel adventurous, J. Wakefield has the most unique beers around. You could go for the Blood Orange Creamsicle or how about the Coco Caramel Sea Salt La Nada? You can really expand your beer horizons and you will find beer that is unlike anything else in the area.",40,August 2016

Safari Edventure,Zoos,FabianKrieger,Best thing to do in the Miami Area,"We visited last july not really knowing what to expect. Upon arrival we were imediately greeted by very nice staff members and that experience continued at the counter where we bought our tickets. We were smart enough to forget our bug repellent, because who needs bug repellent in South Florida!, we didnt even have to ask the kind lady behind the desk who imediately offered that we could use hers. She did not have to do this but deciced to do so anyways. We bought regular admission tickets and extra tickets to pet a sloth. We then walked the 'trail' through the 'park' and absolutely loved every animal exhibition. It might seem like the animals are in relatively small areas but all the animals seemed happy and none showed any signs of sadness. Feeding the monkey-like creatures was our favourite part of the already amazing day. You can buy food for them for $0,25 from a machine next to the exibit. We then continued our walk and went to the wolve encounter where we met a great staff member, sadly i've forgotten his name. He was incredibly friendly and you could tell that his goal was to educate us about the animals. He sure did! Then we made our way to the animal show. This is something you must do if you go here, i will not spoil what you will see but it is incredibly educational and fun at the same time. Especially for children (arent we all?) You can purchase snacks and water from vending machines for about a buck. Highly suggest u bring a couple of dollars to do so if you plan on visiting during the warm days. At the end of the animal show we got to hold the sloths, we we're not rushed at all and given all the time we needed to enjoy this moment. A+ for the day. We will return!",50,July 2016
Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Norberto N,not worth visiting,"Went and the admission price is $30.00 per person. We found the food prices to high as a chicken shish kabob with four little pieces was $8.00 and bottled water was $3.00. It's geared more for children and don't recommend it for adults, unless you are accompanying children. The crowd control is terrible as their is insufficient security or police. WE were heading to another area within the attraction and ran into a massive crowd (horde) of people enter the attraction and they we pushing. I was heading in the opposite direction and was almost trampled. Their were children who were being pushed and toddlers in carriages who almost got injured. It took me over twenty minutes to walk to where I was heading which was a distance of only about 60 feet. I then ran into another area further away an once again it happened again and this time it took over thirty minutes to walk about 100 feet. I informed a security personnel an they only asked ""is someone fighting or injured."" I told them that they needed to get there soon as someone may get injured and a fight may erupt soon due to the given situation. they said ""we'll be there soon."" and took their time. Another lady had a target shopping cart as she headed into the crowd of people. You have been forewarned.",10,December 2015
Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,S S,Same stuff every year,They have the same things every year and seems like the prices are going up high every time.

The only Christmas aspect of this place is found in the decorative lights and displays when you first walk in. Once you pass the giant Christmas tree, it's just a regular old carnival. By old, I mean the rides are dirty and rundown. There is no Christmas decorations, lights, or shows that are holiday oriented whatsoever. This place is simply a carnival and not a theme park so don't expect anything like Disneyland. I went once and won't return again. The entrance fee is outrageous considering you only get a few rides. They advertised all sorts of roller coasters but their kiddie ones at best. The food is expensive and just overall, this so called ""enchanted forest"" is simply a money pit of lies.

The Only Christmas related attractions where found in the entrance of the park, whilst the the rest of the park was a normal fun fair. The Fun Fair part had free rides and shows(the shows were good, that's why the second star) and a lot of other game stalls which came with an additional charge.

Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Michelle S,Park employees so rude!!!!,"Our family's first time at the park. We drove 2 hrs to take our son for his birthday. Upon entering a young man convinced us to buy express passes, he said the park was packed. By the time we reached the rides we realized the lines were very short and to make matters worse our 9 yr old bday boy aw sent tall enough to get on most of the fun rides. We immediately found the young man to ask for a refund or at the very least to refund two passes so my husband and older one could ride while my son and I played games. Not only did he refuse which I could live with but this kid named ISAIAH claimed to be the owner. Later his girlfriend who also works there Told us he was the owners son. He was SO rude and condescending. I literally had to back up a few steps because he was in my face. I couldn't believe the way he treated me and spoke to me especially in front of my children! Needless to say it put a big damper on our night. If in fact he is the owners son it leaves a lot to say about how they feel about the family's that visit their park.

I really dont think you should have people like this working there, because she wasnt just making a 7 years old kid feel bad, she also was racist and lets be honest; the park is not cheap and its not nice to pay all that money to have a great time and someone coming to critic your kid and making him feel bad. i dont know what are you going to do about it, maybe for you is not important but i think that at least you should talk to her and teach her how to treat customers and kids, and apologized to us.",30,December 2015

Barnacle State Historic Site,Historic Sites,Mel_Medd,Peace & Quiet,"The Barnacle is a historic home built in 1891.  It was home to Ralph Middleton Munroe, one of Coconut Grove's most influential pioneers. The home offers a glimpse of life, when all travel to and from Miami was by boat. Munroe sought to preserve the forest on his land, and cut out a small trail through the hammock, barely wide enough for one vehicle. Today, the property contains many large, old trees.  The home is left in its natural state, and appears much as it did in Munroe's days. The Barnacle is a great place to enjoy a picnic on the lawn, a tour through the hammocks, rocking in the chairs in the front porch, or a family night at one of their shows.  Watch the sailboats go by and take a picnic basket.  This site is definitely for the history buffs and peace and quiet seekers. I come here with my boyfriend and roam around. It is very peaceful. We take a blanket with some food and some wine and just chill while taking photos of the historic home. Cute getaway.",50,February 2015

We enjoyed seeing all the lush and pristine vegetation and trees along the path which were well marked, and the further you travel along the path the sounds and vistas off the city seem to disappear.  You actually can see Florida and the hammocks they way they were back at the turn of the late 19th century.

Lush vegetation as you walk down to the main house, lots of little lizards scuttling about, some beautiful trees to be seen. The house tours were not available on our visit, but did not matter. Passing the house, the grounds lead down to the sea. Moored on a small pontoon is the lovely little yacht  Egret, which is a copy of a yacht designed by Ralph Munroe, who's property and land this once was. We sat on a bench and enjoyed the cool sea air and loved it all, so relaxing. Went back up to the house and sat on the rocking chairs, could have stayed there all day. There is information about the house and Munroe, who was a prolific figure in Coconut Grove, and indeed a leading yacht designer and founder of a major yacht club. Have researched more since getting home and is all very interesting, especially if you are a boat lover. Many events take place here , including concerts, yoga sessions and it can be hired for private occasions. We were so glad that we didn't miss out on this lovely place.

The property is perfectly maintained and I loved the recent addition of the gift shop.   We arrived too late for a tour, but there are so many stories to be told about Commodore Munroe and this property, it's worth taking, just to hear about the amazing history.  Katrina, welcomed us at the gift shop and gave us all kinds of updates on current events and celebrations at the park.  Local or not, the Barnacle will take you back in time.

It goes into some depth about the family that built the house, the changes over time and the local area / settlers and now it developed. ",40,April 2016
Barnacle State Historic Site,Historic Sites,tnknitter,Delightful.,"Park on the street or in the lot across from the entrance ($6 flat fee), then stroll down the shady walkway.  If you just need a break, the walkway and restrooms are outside of the fee box, but even the stroll is worth the $2 admission fee.  The tour was also inexpensive at a mere $3 - rare for the area - and very interesting.  The ranger was able to answer all the questions our small group asked of him.  I also liked that the background of the family and the property were delivered as we were comfortably seated on the porch, and that we were allowed to spend ample time examining items and areas of the house.  I went knowing virtually nothing of Florida history, and left with an appreciation for what it took to carve a homestead out of the wilderness only a century ago. Highly recommend.",50,April 2016

The house is very well preserved and has a very interesting story, it is well worth paying for the tour which takes you through the house and shows off artefacts from an age gone by. Lovely views of the bay too.",50,April 2016
Barnacle State Historic Site,Historic Sites,kimibar,A little narrow strip of green,"This is a nice, short walk to one of the few ways to get to the shore in Coconut Grove (which is mostly harbors on the water). It was private property of someone who was inventing outrigger+sail boats. His boat slip is still there and some of the little sheds or houses, but it's not really set up as a museum or anything. There are no chairs or benches at the water's edge. But it's a pleasant momentary escape from the main roads. ",30,April 2016

Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Ruth F,Great holiday family fun,"I am thoroughly exhausted from having so much fun watching my family having so much fun!  I had no idea what to expect and Santa's Enchanted Forest was a WOW!!!  Loved the light parade that greeted us and set the tone for a very magical night. The beautiful displays and the fun shows were ""show-stoppers""....so creative and thoroughly enjoyable.  It was incredible to see so many families enjoying this unique adventure, being courteous and patient while negotiating their way through the crowded park.  Family after family were enjoying themselves just as much as we were. For our family especially, this was the perfect activity to bring North/South cousins together for a memorable evening that will last a lifetime. The rides were awesome and our older girls were running from one fast-paced high speed ride to the next in an explosion of energy and excitement, yet for my more cautious 8 yr-old, there were  enough other more appropriate choices that satisfied her comfort level too. And those express passes...talk about maximizing our time in the park!!!  The ride lines were long and no doubt without the express option we might still be standing on one or two!  Kudos to the friendly staff for keeping the park grounds so clean.  We had a blast and are already making holiday plans for 2015.  Haven't yet experienced the park's Halloween adventure but sounds like a great idea for the kids.",50,December 2014

It took away the after Christmas blues and got us right back into the magic of Christmas. So many beautiful pictures and lights, music and characters everywhere! The food was reasonable and there was a lot to choose from. The lines are best during the weeknights from what I've heard. There were lots of different rides for different ages so they were all happy. We left with Funnel cakes, a blow up dolphin and lots of other prizes from the games...oh and a hundred cool photos with all of the cute decorations. We left at midnight and the kids fell asleep in the car in five minutes with smiles on their faces! A great night!",50,December 2014

It was expensive to get in and then way too expensive inside for food and drinks, The crowd was okay and the lights and decorations were awesome food and drinks were way too much and biggest drawback was it was only Junk Food and Carbs, they should work on this next time atleast have one or two decent vendors who can provide some healthy options. Washrooms were all lined up and lot of time was wasted waiting for rides and rides were limited and crowd was enormous.",30,December 2014
Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Tracey K,SANTAS ANIMAL CRUELTY FOREST,"I WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED THAT LIVE ANIMALS WHERE BEING ABUSED IN PUBLIC AND NOBODY WAS DOING ANYTHING. Is it just accepted in Miami Dade county? I was sick to my stomach watching 4 ponies tied to a rotating wheel with 4 harness walking in circles for hours and hours and hours, like a live carousel!!!!  I saw sea lions in basically an above ground pool doing tricks, poor things living there for 6 weeks!!!!!  A petting zoo with a zebra and ostrich in a very confined space....yea they belong in south Florida!!!! Locked up for weeks then people touching them. I am floored I am almost speechless. I didn't see it but there was a show involving a lion cub....horrible horrible horrible, locked in a cage probably for 16 hrs a day, what a great life!!!!!! At the end I saw a pitiful sad little monkey chained to a pole I don't know what he was doing because I couldn't look. What do these poor animals in cages and forced to perform have to do with CHRISTMAS!!!!  I don't know who to call but I plan on doing something!!! I can deal with carnival atmosphere and old rides and games of chance and greasy food and high prices, but do you really have to publically parade animal abuse in my face??? Just sad and awful and what a message to send to kids. I hope the place goes bankrupt I hated it and will never support or return. I could cry. I didn't mention the world s smallest horse either that I did not see but if it was alive it was confined on a shelf behind a billboard. This whole place makes me embarrassed to be a human being.",10,January 2015
Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Avis239,Pro - we had a great time.  Con - animals have a miserable life there,"We have been wanting to go here for a few years.  From the reviews, you either love the place, or you hate it.  We went with low expectations just to say we finally went.  Turns out we all had a great time.  It was basically a fair with an area of Christmas lights and decorations which was pretty.  People who complained it was too expensive or the food wasn't healthy - well, don't go to a fair.  Fairs are not cheap and they don't sell salads or hummus. We did get the Express Pass which was almost the price of admission, but were so glad we did.  You don't waste your time being annoyed standing in line after line.  You get to walk right up ahead of the line.  We only got two passes for the avid riders in the group.  The others only went on a couple rides.  We had no problem with the game vendors yelling at us like others had said.  Some call to invite you to play, but again, it's a normal fair atmosphere.  But no one was pushy or rude.  Actually at the few games we played the folks running it were very nice.  The only down side was the poor animals.  We did not ride or pet any.  Just tried not to look.  I do wish they would not have any live animals at all at the fairs, or circuses for that matter.  So basically it is your standard fair with the bonus of lots of Christmas lights and displays as you walk in.  We would go again.  And would spend the extra for the Express Pass.  It is only once a year and saves you time and aggravation.",40,December 2014

Barnacle State Historic Site,Historic Sites,MandyKandy,Quiet Memorial Day,I went to this park on Memorial day weekend with my boyfriend. It was nice it's a $2 donation per person that you pay at the front. Unfortunately we got there too late to take a tour of the house but we are planning on going back for that the tour is $3 per adult. We had a nice quite picnic in the grass near the bay listening to the water in the background was quite a lovely experience. The park is smaller than I imagined for a location that is considered a state park but it was quaint. There were only a few other people there besides us so it was nice to avoid a crowd. This location is also pet friendly and even has a water bowl near the water fountains for your four legged friends.,30,May 2016
Barnacle State Historic Site,Historic Sites,Freja72,Lovely grounds and interesting site,"The Barnacle is an easy walk from Cocowalk in Coconut Grove, and it is quite interesting and beautiful. The grounds are heavily treed as you enter, and the historic home is quite lovely, from the exterior. We were unable to enter the building because there are limited times for tours and we   hadn't arrived at an appropriate time, but just wandering down to the boathouse and reading the plaques was enough to get a good idea of the history of the location. The entry fee is truly laughably small, and pretty much goes on the honour system, so we felt it necessary to drop in a little extra cash. For a nice walk and a bit of history, this is quite a lovely spot.",40,May 2016

Staff wise it was the worst state park I have ever been to in Florida (they are usually very good).

You can expect to see a wide ranges of species such as: wolves, snakes, lizards, birds, barn yard animals, foxes, kangaroos, sloths, possums.  I have a running list of over 60+ animals.  At the presentation you will get an opportunity to touch some of the animals such as an alligator, a sloth, a kangaroo, a tarantula, etc.  This was definitely the highlight of my trip to Miami and I highly encourage any animal lovers to play this place a visit.",50,February 2017

My family members are animal lovers so this is a must do when they visit from New Jersey. The animals are loved by the caretakers and most are rescues that makes it more special. The show was both informative and fun. They are very knowledgeable and patient. This is the closest expierience that anyone can get to a sloth, kangaroo, etc. . The wolf encounter is always one of my favorite , but this visit was even more special. The Wolves had two litters of pups and the highlight was holding and snuggling with them. We fell in love with them. My family loved the expierence.  If you are on the fence about going go sooner than later while they pups are ready for handling..... if your like me wear sneakers.

Safari Edventure,Zoos,katiegeary628,Such a fun unique experience,"Went to safari edventure for the ""in the scenes"" tour with my sister whose favorite animal is the sloth. (So as you can imagine we were there specifically for the sloth. lol) they advised us upon arrival that sometimes the sloth doesn't feel like being held and hands on interaction isn't guaranteed but regardless we would be able to visit the sloth. Lauren was our tour guide and she was amazing! Super informative and friendly. But of course the sloth wasn't feeling it this morning. Glen, who I believe is the owner came to check on us and knowing that my sister loved sloths and was there specifically for him told us to come find him after our tour and if the sloth was feeling more friendly later he would bring us back to the sloth exhibit. So we went along with our tour, fed gators, emus, porcupine and had hands on interaction with wolves and their pups! So cool! After finishing our tour we were given livestock food to feed the goats and horses. So as we're feeding the animals Glen went out of his way to track us down because Merlin the sloth was feeling friendly! It was such an amazing experience but the customer service they provided (while respecting and loving their animals) was above and beyond. We definitely recommend this place and will be visiting again with friends. ",50,March 2017

There were so many animals there and the staff talked to us about each of them from the bunnies, to the tortoises to the birds, etc  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The animals are all well taken care of.  Definitely worth going to!",50,March 2017
Safari Edventure,Zoos,ryamss64,You cannot go wrong,"Safari Edventure was very enjoyable. One in our group of 4 were able to hold the sloth, a little disappointing but okay. Touched and fed the prehensile tailed porcupines, fed the alligators (awesome - the way they come up to get fed it almost, almost makes you forget you cannot pet them), Got in the pen with the arctic wolves and timber wolves and then there was the wolf cubs. The price for the private tour, you cannot go wrong compared to other experiences in the area that cost much more. I did want to feed the baby pigs, when I went to buy bottles at the ticket area I was told it was included in the tour, it never happened. A little disappointed, but the other edventures were excellent. We did not stay for the 'show', we only caught the end to see the kangaroo and the kids were able to pet her.",50,March 2017

Safari Edventure,Zoos,Marissa A,Best Animal Interactions in South FL,"My family absolutely adores Safari Edventure. Took my daughter for her 5th birthday & the whole family loved it. We interacted will all types of animals during the presentation & we spent some time getting to know the wolves where we actually were able to enter the enclosure & interact with him. He just visit again this past weekend to meet the arctic wolf pups that were just born earlier this year. It was such an amazing experience. They have tons of other animals to see like lemurs, pigs, monkeys, porcupines & talking parrots that are seriously funny. The best part about this place is it's CHEAP & FL residents save a few additional bucks on entry. If you're a local with children I suggest looking into the membership. You'll definitely get more bang for your buck if you plan on visiting several times throughout the year.",50,April 2017

I thought I was the problem and wanted to be fair but that was not the case. This place is crowded, overpriced and run down. It is at a great location but it turns out to be no more than a cheap fair. It does not say Christmas to me. It is not worth the trip. I think that Miami has a need for a theme park. Such a great need that it keeps this place open out of public desperation for a place to gather, celebrate and feel a sense of community.",10,November 2017
Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Erika A,"Expensive, Outdated and Overrated","This place is highway robbery. They don't offer a ""no ride"" price for those who just want to walk around and eat. People spend way too much on entrance that includes some rides $37+ another $20 for a fast pass because if you don't buy that option, you will ride 3 things because of overcrowding. Then the decorations are very outdated and it breaks my heart to see the treatment they give to the animals. Its abuse! They will not get my money!!! I prefer to buy better gifts and attend other events in the city than go there. Don't waste your money because for a family of 4, you will easily spend $300+ ",10,December 2016

Barnacle State Historic Site,Historic Sites,mmonsalve7,Very little to do at this park,"OK so personally - I liked the park and would rate it a 4 stars because I liked how secluded it was and quiet while being surrounded by bars and restaurants.  However, I know that many people will visit and find that there isn't much to do at this park.  I think its great that the house and its land are preserved.  I took the tour of the house and found it interesting (its only $3).  I believe there are also 1-2 geocaches on this property if you are into that activity.  The view of the water is pretty.  It is also a great place to picnic.  I brought a notebook and wrote for about an hour.  It was very relaxing to sit by the water and write (there are no tables there so I just wrote on my lap).  If you are looking for a park with activities like kayaking, hiking, bike paths, etc, then this will not be the park for you.  If you are searching for somewhere different to sit and meditate or have a quiet moment, then you will love this park.",30,April 2017

Ultra Music Festival,Music Festivals,Bebofolies,"Sold and priced as the best, far away from it. Should be called: Ultra 3 Days Music.","Ok Miami so ok it's expensive (more than 120$ a day, 8$ a beer 0.4L and 7$ a dry slice of pizza) but don't say it's the best EDM festival in the world. First it's not a festival, it's a 3 days music with a great line up (except for the most overrated dj, ahahah dj, David Guetta) and the awesome location in down town Miami among skyscrapers but the organization and the audio quality... please! Let's start with the organization: Miami in March, 40 degrees and you start it at noon? The temperature is fine from 6/7pm and the music finishes at midnight? We were almost more queuing than in the actual 'festival'. And now the audio. The very big down of the festival. Unless you go within 5 meters far and in front of the speakers the audio is like in my apartment parties listening music from the terrace, ok a bit exaggerating but you got an idea. If you want to go an proper EDM festival have a look at what happens in Zamardi, Hungary around June/July every year since 2006.",20,March 2016

Safari Edventure,Zoos,Maytraveler,Hidden Gem,"We visited on Mother's Day.  Had the first ""ITS tour"" at 10am.  I was blown away!  Chris was our personal guide to the animals, he was full of information and helped us hold, touch pet tons of animals. We started with the wolves, they are so fabulous. I could not believe how sweet they were, and the large black male was so mischievous and funny.  Then we moved on to the pups. Energetic fur balls that snuggled and climbed in your lap.  They were adorable.  Then on to feed porcupine babies and pet them.  Then we fed hot dogs to the adolescent gators.  The power of those jaws!  Then we fed, rubbed and held a baby sloth.  Then we held a beautiful crested cockatoo.  She was very attentive and danced, kissed and fanned her head feathers all while sitting gently on our arms.  Then we fed goats, ponies and donkeys.  Then to the show!  Tarantulas, frogs, snakes, alligators, chinchillas, opossum, an adult sloth and a baby kangaroo rounded out the line up.  Best value for your money!  Schedule the ITS tour it is so worth every penny",50,May 2017

Safari Edventure,Zoos,Nurseerika1,Deplorable conditions for animals,I can not believe this place is allowed to be open let alone have animals. The condition of the cages and enclosures were deplorable. It looks as if they haven't been cleaned in months. I have been to many rehabilitation and sanctuaries for animals and I have never seen anything this bad. The water the alligators are in is completely green. Some of the other tanks for turtles and fish were also green and could barely see through it. One of the pigs had a huge soar on its leg which was bright red and full of bugs. Another donkey or pony had the same issue. I felt so bad for these animals. They were probably rescued or surrendered from bad living conditions and are forced to live in another disgraceful place. If they cannot properly care for the animals they should surrender them to a place that can. ,10,May 2017
Safari Edventure,Zoos,QuixotePanza,Know the animals first hand,"This place is not a zoo, is more a farm where they love animals and make people love animals. it does not have a great infrastructure, it does not have great attractions but they really care for animals. Do not miss the exhibition when animal keepers explain all the animals and allow you to touch them and to take care of them. Finally, get to touch and pet the wolves and the kangaroo.",50,December 2016

The make it seem as if they are dropping you to the front entrance and that the walk to the entrance is a mile long... Not! By the time they wait on more patrons, load everyone in and take the slow ride to drop you off near the entrance, you would've wasted more time taking the trolley than you would've if you had just took the short walk.

Victoria was directing us when and where to turn and after 4 minutes of walking she said it is just ahead on the left. We stepped past a wall and were stunned by the huge mural of Darth Vader on the wall. Tim's wife Christina is a huge fan and their two Corgies are Anakin and Luke. We took several pics while listening to one of the JWB team telling us we were in a for a great beer adventure. Walking through the doors Star Wars continued with a wall of various murals and several characters. We found 3 stools at the bar and Andrew came over to tell us about many things including beer, Star Wars and other cool movie things in the tap room. The beer list had lots of IPAs and Sours and we tasted several with Andrew providing indepth knowledge to help us. Tim went with sour for the first round, Punch it Chewie, Victoria and I went IPA with Slamming Bones and Frank White respectively. All were great and we watched the place start to fill as the afternoon progressed. Second round started with a few more tastings. Tim stayed with sour having Stush, Victoria had 24th ST Brown Ale and I went with El Jefe. Again they were all exceptional. We thanked Andrew, stopped and told the owner how much we loved the SW theme and the great beers.We will make another trek with our wives in the next couple months and let them experience the wonder of JWB.",50,August 2018
J. Wakefield Brewing,Breweries,687travisb,Prices were ridiculous!,"First off, I’m a big fan of J. Wakefield and their beers. I love the selection on draft and the brewery has an awesome Star Wars theme going on. The reason for the one star rating is the prices I paid per flight. We got 2 flights (eight 5-oz pours) and I was charged $45.36 (before I tipped and I did give the bartender 20%, I’m not that much of an d-bag). Basically got charged $1 per oz on most pours, but $7 alone for one taster of “I’m Your Huckleberry”. Come the fu*k on JWB... really?!? I paid £6 for a similar 4-oz pour of Sink the Bismarck at Brewdog Edinburgh (beer with 41% ABV). You have great beer, but either you overestimate how good it is or you just price your tasters outrageously high. The avg flight at any brewery I’ve been to is $7-12 for 4-5 5-oz pours, not the ~$20 you guys charge. Either way it will be quite awhile before I buy another beer from you guys over that sh*t.",10,September 2018

Bay of Pigs Museum,Specialty Museums,Continent8,Bay of betrayal,We visited this small Museum in Little Havana in early December. It may look closed but it is probably open----a buzzer will unlock the door for you.  Few artifacts remain from a disaster where everyone is either killed or captured from a country that we have not recognized for over fifty years. It is a small wonder that few things are displayed. The staff took a dim view of John Kennedy. Hard to blame them. They had trained to go in through a small town with dock facilities. Kennedy changed their destination to a swamp with only one or two roads out that could be easily defended-----changed it within 36 hours of the invasion!!!   After the first wave hist the beaches Kennedy also decided to cancel air cover. It was suicide and sure defeat. If anything this museum explains those things.,30,December 2013
Bay of Pigs Museum,Specialty Museums,90pedroc,Small Museum that shows to the world that Kennedy sent these men and left them to die,"Sad bit of our history in which we sent a brigade of men trained by the CIA, into Cuba, they were supposed to land in another part of Cuba, but at the last minute it was changed, also they forego the air support and over 50,000 Cuban troops waited for them in shore, it is one of the biggest debacles that our Country has made by endangering these men's lives, which only a few made it through.

Ultra Music Festival,Music Festivals,ARodriguezP,An experience like no other!!!,"This Ultra (#19) was our 2nd time (#17 was our 1st) .... and we really enjoyed it! Our roommate and good  friend Orlando has attended every Ultra Music Festival since day one,it was he who bought our tickets the first time and he had no idea we would be there this time but by chance we were able to get  tickets last minute. We didn't attend  opening on Friday but we did go Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday my first objective was to find our well seasoned friend to surprise him with our presence,not an easy task given the fact that with multiple stages and thousands of people it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. It took us over an hour to find him but since I have been sharing dance floors with my friend off and on for over 17 years after an hour or so I remembered he likes to be on the edge of the crowd where he has space to dance so that is where I found him! You can imagine his surprise when he saw my partner and I coming up to him,we hugged and danced around in circles for what seemed like an eternity stopped in time! Ultra #19 will always be special because of that surprise but I guess every single Ultra is special in it's own particular way,it's a festival that attracts people from all over the world to enjoy the latest in house,electronic dance and trance music. And yes some people tend to get overenthusiastic with their partying but overall everyone gets along with no major issues and no fighting just a lot of good vibes and incredibly positive energy! And with the backdrop of beautiful downtown Miami and Biscayne Bay it will always be a special event with special people coming together to make special memories!

Ultra Music Festival,Music Festivals,YumAlerter,Best tech fest!,"Loyal for years & gets bigger each year. 6 stages, all good. The people make this festival incredible. No one seems to be too old, too young, too extreme or tame. Outfits ares incredible. Festival grew from 1 day to 3 to 2 weekends. Best to stay but need to make arrangements year in advance for best location/price. The Hilton overlooks the park and and great stay, but gets more expensive each year and requires 3 night stay for this festival weekend. There are plenty of other options though and you can navigate without car. I have to say that the Okeechobee Music Festival is taking the festival competition to new level with Cochella/camping appeal and brings back a bit of what Ultra lost getting a bit too big. Nothing will ever fully compare to this venue and if you are thinking about it do it! DO IT. Prepare to stand for many hours. Prepare for massive crowds. Plenty of port o lets. Can pay for VIP for extra perks (worth it). Security search on way in, be smart - careful not to dehydrate. Paramedics handy.",50,March 2017

We wanted to have an interaction with the animals but were told they were all booked!  There were like 3 other families in the place!  We did get to go in the wolf enclosure and pet the wolves.  The staff member that was with us was very knowledgeable.",20,July 2017

Safari Edventure,Zoos,jimler,Lots of Animal Interaction,"We visited in mid-July with our two teenage sons 15 &18.  We did the ITS tour and also watched the presentation.  During the ITS tour, there was a lot of hands-on interaction such as giving a bottle to the baby pigs, feeding alligators (behind a cage), feeding emus, petting and holding a baby wolf, feeding porcupines, interacting with a talking bird.  During the presentation, we got to hold a tarantula and a huge bermise python, and see and learn about other animals as well.  Some of the enclosures could have been bigger, but they are rescued/rehabbed animals and the workers seemed to care about them.  It was a fun couple of hours.",40,July 2017

de la Cruz Collection,Art Museums,miamirower,Knowledgable staff made art museum delightful,"The de la Cruz Collection is a terrific small museum specializing in contemporary art.  It usually is not crowded so viewing is comfortable and unhurried.  On our last visit we had access to several knowledgeable staff members who provided valuable educational information and made our experience so much more interesting.  My friends and I especially appreciated the booklets that are available for each of the 3 floors that provide background on the artists and explain their concepts.  So even if you aren't lucky enough to have staff members to interact with, the museum provides you with enough guidance that you come away feeling like you have really learned a lot about the artists and the art that you have seen. The fact that the museum is in the Design District is an added plus.  Before or after your museum visit you will have access to many fine restaurants as well as amazing stores and architecture.

The exhibition I saw, ""You've Got to Know the Rules...to Break Them,"" showed an expanse of media with a range of expression. What I saw was all toward the modern end and included the likes of Martin Kippenberger and Evan Holloway. Many larger than life works seemed completely at home in this sizable space. Housing 20 or so works, the exhibitions seems to change with some frequency - all graciously provided from the private de la Cruz collection AT NO COST.

Margaret Pace Park,Parks,Joseph F,Dog park first and foremost ,"This park is a nice place to go play tennis, volleyball, enjoy the exercise equipment or allow your children to play in an enclosed area that is set up and shaded. What detracts from the park is that the dog owners have virtually completely taken over. There are signs stating where dogs are allowed in that they are to be leashed. Unfortunately, dog owners believe that the rules don't apply to their pets. Dogs have essentially taken over the park and for the most part are on leave. This makes it uncomfortable for people who are not crazy about someone else's dog. There is a pretty cool basketball court that always has competitive games being played. They're also nice benches in which to enjoy the views of the water. If the dog owners would be more respectful, this would be an outstanding place to enjoy time with your family. Paragraph I suggest you visit for yourself and reach her own opinion. There are certainly many things to do at this park at no cost. There's also an excellent coffee shop directly across the street where you can get good Italian food and coffee.",30,November 2013

The smell was terrible. Many of the stalls were out of toilet paper and all of them were out of sanitizer. I went with a group of 7 friends and all of us returned home puking. I've been to spring awakening, moonrise, edc Orlando, and lost lands but I paid the most for Ultra by far the worst when it comes to sanitation and organization. I was even warned by the people at EDC that the people that go to ultra do not understand PLUR and now I get it.

Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,Kristigirl,Lots of problems this year,"They are missing rides from the last few years...and it's two of our favorites!  What happened to the giant slide that you walk up with your burlap sack and ride down?  What happened to the giant swings?  My daughter and I were so very upset when we could not locate them!  One carnival worker on the ride that drops straight down did not even want to get up and work the ride....he was so lazy.  He just pointed at my kids from a distance and told us they were too short.  I asked him to get up and measure them.  They weren't.  The dude just was so disinterested in being there in NYE.  On the bright side, NYE is a good time to go with fewer people, but so many of the workers are disinterested in being there!     I also bought a bottled water out of the machine, gave it a $5 bill, and it only gave me 50 cents back.  I was annoyed enough at the $3 charge, only to find that the machine did not give the proper change, so I ended up paying $4.50 for a bottle of water.  The prices for food are pretty preposterous too.  We had bought fast passes for that night, only to find out we never needed them.  They should not allow anyone to buy fast passes on nights that are slow.  Or they should give you the option at the park, not online.  There are no refunds.  Apparently NYE is always a slow night.  It is also a shorter night, something they do not advertise until you walk into the park.  It closes an hour earlier that usual.  They should post that on the website, my kids were crushed.  Oh well....I donated a lot of money to SEF this year....maybe they can use it to fix some of these problems and bring all the rides back?  I hope this post helps someone else and the info gets to the owners!",20,December 2018
Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,zivfam,Enjoyable but Expensive,If you plan to go once as a family the cost of admission/rides/food/drink can be expensive.

Once you leave the car, you start experiencing how a ran down park looks like.  Nothing is well maintained, you cant really get in the water, the concession stand is abandoned.  In addition they advertise some rides that are not functioning.

The beach is dirty with trash all over the sand. A lot of insects including mosquitoes requires some repellent, otherwise is hell. The price to get in is too high for what it has to offer (8$) and the worse part, the Flag advisory is not displayed in the entrance and it should have as it was in Red (which means, no swimming.  Ticket is non-refundable by the way). The current was strong yet we decided to swim and enjoy the day for as much as those 8$ could buy.

de la Cruz Collection,Art Museums,gimletbean,The most pleasant surprise,"My friend and I were wandering the design district during some unfortunately foul weather on our recent trip to Miami. We just did a cursory search of nearby places and decided to pop in on a whim. This place is such a treasure! The collection's mission is so admirable--a private collection in a beautiful, designated space open to the public for free. It's an amazing, thoughtful collection, too. I love contemporary art, and the staff member (gosh I wish I could remember her name, she was fantastic!) gave my friend and I and another visitor a wonderful guided tour of the collection and it was so fascinating. This will be the first thing I tell people to see if they're in Miami should the weather turn foul (or if they're contemporary art enthusiasts). I learned so much, and it figuratively and literally brightened our day. Kudos to the De la Cruz family!",50,November 2016
de la Cruz Collection,Art Museums,annettefromm,Try to attend their occasional lectures,"This is an art collection - one of Miami's single, owner, so-called vanity museums - and more.  If you enjoy contemporary art it is a must see.  But you should also get on their mailing list for the occasional lectures.  Well-known artists, curators, and others periodically speak for free.  These programs are great mixers, a way to see the museum, and provide insight into the art there.  Sit up close to make sure you hear the presentation because the acoustics in the hall are not good.",40,January 2017

The story of the De La Cruz' is unique and few people would do what they have done.  Also, the staff is wonderful as well and very interested in your experience at the space.  Even if you are not a fan of modern art you will come away with a new respect for what is happening in the art world when it comes to this art.  Please visit whether you love art or not.  You will not regret it!  Our guide Daniel was extremely knowlegable and shared many stories about the collection, the De La Cruz family and the background of many artists as well as what's going on currently in the art world with respect to specific artists represented in the collection.  Also many stories about putting art in this space!",50,March 2017

You don't hear much about it but when you get there and find that beautiful beach with parking, cabanas, calm and very clean waters you feel like including this destination in your must see map of Miami. I would avoid weekends, since like most beaches in Miami, it is full of people making barbecue. But during week days, there is very few people and you feel like being on a private beach. Also like other beaches in Miami, there are pebbles (rounded/ pointless rocks) near the water but the ""torture"" of crossing the 6 feet layer is compensated by the wonderful water.",50,May 2014

Margaret Pace Park,Parks,CityandColourful,So much potential ,This park has so much potential and a truly beautiful view. I used to live next door and you can't really go during the summer because the people who walk their dogs here let their dogs poo on the side walks even though there is a separate space for dogs but some people don't have respect for others and let their dogs poo anywhere and they don't feel obligated to pick it up. The smell from the hot sun hitting it is absolutely disgusting. You literally have to hopscotch around poo. The bay on the far right smells awful during the summer as well. There's also a significant problem with homeless people here. It wouldn't bother me except there are a few that are very clearly mentally unstable and have made me feel uneasy and unsafe with and without my child. ,20,October 2015

Since we came by bike we were not charged the $6 / car entrance fee.  This fee seems very small if you plan to spend a family day  at the beach.   We were surprised by how well laid out the whole park area is.  It was an easy ride through the main road and some side roads.  I remember coming to this beach in the 80's and even though it was quiet and serene, it had fallen into disrepair.  At the northern end we found excellent mountain trails maintained by volunteers.  At first we were a little hesitant, but were so glad we tried out the ""novice"" trail that had picture perfect views of downtown Miami and Miami Beach.  The volunteer crew even lent us a couple of helmets which we had not brought.   There are many  areas undergoing restoration which will hopefully restore the native hammocks and beach areas.

Then we drove over to Virginia Key Beach, near the Marine Stadium.  The beach is nothing like it used to be. Virginia Key Beach was THE beach in the 70's.  Everybody went there.  South Beach didn't exist.  It was lined with old dilapated hotels filled with elderly people sitting around.  It was known for that. The art deco hotel transformations came in the 80's.  Virginia Key Beach was the main beach and it was beautiful. Palm trees studded the beach and other tropical vegetation  You could cook out on the beach, picnic, and it was a major family beach.  I still have photos of the way it was. The zoo was in Crandon Park on Key Biscayne--the Crandon Park Zoo.  After the beach we would go to the zoo, it was close by. Everything was free. The beach was closed for a time, then it was decided to renovate it, which they are doing now.  Unfortunately, it will never be like the old beach. The beaches on Key Biscayne are better, especially Cape Florida Bill Bagg's State Park.  If you go to the end you can look out over the water and see Stiltsville, or see a manatee, or, go to the lighthouse area which is very pretty. We've seen weddings there.",30,July 2013

Feeling insulted i carried on to see a cop car parked in the middle of the street he approached my vehcle and asked what i was doing and where i was going in an interrogating tone(need i mind u i was not speeding or anything of the sort) asked if there were beaches there that thats where i was heading he says you can go now there were no signs and a fork in the rd so i asked him which way to go for the beaches he just looked back and said you csan go asked again which way says again you can go ahead. Got to beach it was like a ghost town all lots on the way to main area were closed off, nature trail closed off. i was wondering if the beach was opened at all. it was a ghost town even the raccoon looked sick that i saw. then i read somehing about a restoration project on a posterboard lasting till dec 2013 ...this place was a $6 insult.

Wow. What a cool concept. The art is contemporary, mostly German and American, and the space is open, bright and well curated over three floors. I loved so many of the works, and felt like I was getting a really intimate view of someone’s private life! My favourite artist was Felix Gonzales-Torres, who I knew nothing about, but loved his installations, especially the one that allows you to take candy from the gallery. This collection might be better than the ICA. Shh.",50,March 2018

There are raccoons on the island that like to come out at night and crocodiles. I never personally encountered one of the two except for from afar. If you are camping, don't leave food out in the tent or you may find a creature or two joining you in the tent.

Ultra 5K was born.  People walking home on the bridge.  They admitted the first night was a failure and they pledged to fix it for night 2... well it was a little more organized, people walked again, seeing if they could improve on their 5K time... but we only got back to hotel 10 minutes earlier than night before.  Not wanting to repeat for a third time, we opted to leave early the last night.  Still a challenge to find a bus, I guess because they didn’t expect people to leave at 9...?  Artists/DJ’s were great.  A little sound bleed from the proximity of the stages, but inside it was great.  I literally didn’t want to leave.

Wakefield Brewing to escape the heat and grab a couple of drinks. The place is air conditioned, self-serve water and clean restrooms. We wanted to try a bunch of the beers, which are brewed right on site, so we ordered 5 oz of a few types each. Our bartender was helpful letting us know the most popular beers and (for my boyfriend) the darkest beers. These were served in cute Star Wars-themed “flight” trays, which matches the trendy superhero/Star Wars decor everywhere. The El Jefe was my favorite, and also apparently their most popular. Seems popular with locals and tourists alike. You can also purchase some select cans and large bottles to go. Would highly recommend stopping here on a hot day while exploring Wynwood!",50,October 2019

What was worse was that we brought out-of-towers with us who are BIG IPA fans to try Wakefields famed IPA brew. Don’t get me wrong...the beer was spectacular and Wakefield has most definitely not lost his touch. However, someone took their finger off the pulse of the ambiance. The place felt like a morgue. There was no music...no vibe. A large screen TV was playing a movie that was being watched by 6-8 patrons. The customer service which was always a big part of the staff had deteriorated into a few employees who just wanted to serve your beer and move on.

Rubell Family Collection,"Art Museums, Art Galleries",Cuisinartisan,Shaky start,"Now in its new location in Allapattah the Rubell Museum shows off a repurposed warehouse in slick surroundings with a courtyard cafe and a soon to open basque restaurant. The problem is not with the space or the well known collection. Like many other Miami establishments the Rubell slips with its mediocre reception staff. They don’t give seniors a break on the entrance fee, only children and local residents and then only if you show them proof that you’re a resident. So if you have homes in Miami and New York but can only show a NY drivers license you’re not a local and have to pay a higher fee. Never mind that you pay property taxes in Miami. A week prior when I first visited the reception never made a distinction between residents and non residents. So they have a confusing and disproportionate entrance fee policy adhered to by perfect nitwits who are following the day’s fluctuating script. As a private museum, the Rubell can charge what it wants, in the process they’re going to piss off a lot of residents and non residents alike.",10,December 2019

Our experience was led by one of the soldiers who lived it and then survived as a POW for 2+ years, in Cuba, after the invasion… very moving.

Carlos Leon then offered to give us a personal account of his experience as a soldier and subsequent imprisonment. It was a mesmerizing story that made history come alive. It helped our teenagers understand the significance of what happened (and didn’t happen). We also talked to J.R. Lopez de la Cruz, the museum president, and Dr. Eduardo Zayass-Bazán.

However, all of this is FREE, the building itself is worth seeing (from an interior perspective it really is good ), you're next door to the de la Cruz which is much better and landed in the design district which itself is worth a wander - so it's all good in the end.",30,November 2019

Santa's Enchanted Forest,Theme Parks,J M,We had a great time!,"I should first say my sister won tickets so four adults got in for free. We were not expecting much because the reviews on here were so negative, but we were happily surprised. We got there at 5 when it opened and walked right in with our free tickets. We rode six rides and never waited in line more than 5 minutes. I had almonds which were all great, especially the avocados. It's basically a fair, but since you don't have to pay for rides, you can ride all of them and as often as you would like. The bathrooms were clean, maybe because we were so early, as was the rest of the park. I read lots of reviews about Rusty rides, rude workers, dirty bathrooms, and negative experiences but that's not what we had. I will say most of the employees seemed pretty miserable and unfriendly, maybe two of them were somewhat courteous and I'm not even sure one of them ever smiled. I guess if I were working there during Christmas time for pennies I might feel the same way, but that was about the only negative thing I have to say about our experience. The lights and Christmas decoration were nothing fancy but they were cute.",40,December 2019

The current inaugural exhibition is definitely for adults only.  At least some of what is there, however it is quite amazing the extraordinary range of contemporary Art that is in the space. Incredible sculptures, paintings, drawings, videos.   There are two mirrored rooms you can go inside which are quite amazing.  Their collection of Keith Haring paintings drawings and sculpture is some of the best I’ve seen.  The rebels have collected art from all over the world and you’ll get to be inspired in 36 different rooms of art.  Give yourself plenty of time.

This is a truly interesting collection - and while some might zip through in an hour, you are cheating yourself.  2 hours plus to take it all in.  Much of the art has a distinct POV, and very little of it is mindless or simply one note angry - as some contemporary can be (IMOP).  Most of the pieces here engender thougt, mental convernsations.  The two 'light box' exhibits are among the better of I've seen from the artist.

Multiple times a staff member would come by and ask if we had questions. A few staff members even took time to explain some of the art and the history behind the pieces from the artists perspective.

de la Cruz Collection,Art Museums,scott r,Worth seeing even if you are not particularly into contemp art,"The building itself is an impressive space, well suited to the scale of several oversize installations.  Museum entrance hidden - essentially unmarked -  in a courtyard on the left side of the building - the idea is that one rings the bell as though one were visiting a private residence.  As with all contemporary art (my opinion) some of it is self-indulgent - the artist and thier reviewers believing their own press.  Some of it derivative - and some of it is thought provoking.  Most of it is interesting.  At least, and at best, contemporary art does not shy away from a social point of view.  I ended up with what amounted to a private tour / walking commentary from one of the employees - whether he took an interest in my interest or functioned as a sort of security was never quite clear.  But he stayed with me througout, and had a good knowledge of the particular artists, items, installations - and art itself; we spend time discussing various collections we'd both visited - and ranged from Monet to Turner.  It did add to the experience.  Fascinating that this was all collected and funded by one gentleman and his wife, still collecting and - one assumes - still fabulously wealthy.  Most remarkable of all - it's free!  (Applause to the de la Cruz family; what a nice give back)",50,November 2019

I'm not sure if it was the first night kinks needing to be worked out, or if the sound is always that bad. The guy who played Frankie Valli was way too loud and the girls who played the singers couldn't be heard, much less understood. It wasn't my favorite venue. I have been to many theaters. This was my first time here, though. Ii thought the concession areas at the entrance made it very claustrophobic and hard to move.

Everything was very clean. Staff members pleasant.  I sat upstairs and seats, were comfortable. Only complain I had was they had house lights in the front corner booth where an Interpreter was signing to hearing impaired patrons were very bright. Where I sat upstairs it was very distracting because at times brighter than the stage. I am light sensitive so it was really bothering me.  At one point I even left my seat an asked an usher if there was a way to reduce the light brightness. She informed me I would have to go downstairs and speak to the manager. Since I would miss to much of the play I just went back in and didn't look at the stage. I applaud them for having this service available for the many disabled patrons but feel the lighting can be adjusted to accommodate other patrons with issues to. Maybe they need to move that box so its not center stage. I'm not sure where someone in my situation could sit to avoid this, so I won't be purchasing tickets here again. I attend many events and have never experienced this problem at other venues that offer services to support the patrons with disabilities but hope they might find a happy medium to accommodate all patrons.",30,March 2017

The Centurion Lounge,Airport Lounges,grittyhub,Quality lounge,"I have looked forward to visiting an American Express Centurian lounge and recently had the opportunity to try the Miami one out with the family. They are sadly lacking in Euope. I was not dissapointed. A nice welcome from the pleasant staff on the front desk. I showed my Platinum card, passport and boarding pass and we were in after being given advice on how to book a (free) massage. My wife and I both had a massage - you simply book a time and wait your turn after filling a form with a few details. I think we waited about 1 hour. A very good selection of food was provided and I liked the small touches like the salad with different varieties and colours of tomatoes. There were also dishes we had not tried before. There was a great selection of wine and the opportunity to have a latte from the coffee machine. It was a bit smaller than I had anticipated but there were extra spaces to the right and left of the main reception area. I was hoping to use one at JFK in NYC but it seems this has not opened yet. Maybe i'll get there another time.",50,August 2018

I have taken my kids for family events and other non-broadway shows like stomp, cirque Eloise, Rock of Ages, as well as Broadway shows like Wicked, Motown, Phantom, Sound of Music, Mamma Mia, Jersey Boys, and many more.

Streaky polish, uneven nails, lotion not rubbed in. Thankfully I was going home to undo this mess and get a real manicure. I would have been upset if I was jet setting elsewhere. Bar was great and food service adequate but too small of a space and what’s the point of a spa if not adequate & friendly service? One star for Spa and 3 for lounge. ",30,March 2018

I always like to try local beers whenever I have the chance. The area, if you haven't been is quite interesting, in the most positive sense. It's not like the cliche ""Miami"" scene here. The space has a few bar stools and tables. The rest is family style seating, so a great way to get to know new people. The few beers I did try were great. I'm more of a pilsner or stout girl; I know, contrasting. But I had a red ale there that I was actually quite found of. I sampled everything my friends ordered as well and I wasn't disappointed by anything at our table. They had a food truck there that night, though I'm not sure if that's an all the time thing.

Now for a lounge that only allows platinum and black card members I am shocked at the terrible uncomfortable seating they have here. I think you can make it look a little bit more upscale than cheap little cafe tables and chairs that looks like I'm at Burger King. The food options are terrible. There should be more snacks available than just cookies and the salad bar is really just unappetizing. The little meals they have are like one bite meals. Now on the other hand the bar is fabulous, every alcohol you could imagine and all top shelf stuff (which is expected) they only give real champagne to black card members. For how big it is and how many people there are, you should expand the spa so that more people can get the benefit of using it seeing as it is one of our ""benefits"".

Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Theaters,Howard B,Cannot imagine Miami without the Arsht,"I have been to both the Ziff and the Knight halls on more than a few occasions.  I can not imagine Miami without the Arsht. Miami is an great city and has an eclectic food scene, nightclubs and beaches but a city that does not support the arts can not really be world class.  There is a great variety of entertainment to come through the Arsht; symphonies, ballet, theatre, other types of music and comedy.  I have been to see the MISO and the Cleveland orchestras, comedians, as well as, some ballet and Flamenco dancers - how is that for variety!  The pricing for all events is reasonable for what you see and the venues are well designed and maintained. The structures are newer and very modern.  The structures might be a little soulless but they are very useful and there are virtually no bad seats anywhere. At least they are ""all in"" on the modern theme - and this is very much in step with Miami as a whole.  The staffing is good and always courteous.  There are usually food kiosk available for light food and drinks and the quality is decent although here it is a little over priced.  If there is anything lacking about a night at the Arsht it's that there is not much of a food, bar or cafe scene around the facility.  It must be that The Center is a little newer.  I really hope this changes over time.  I am sure businesses in that area would benefit from the schedule of The Center.  There is one restaurant on site, but since there is only one - it's always very busy.  All in all, I am very happy to have the Arsht in Miami!  I look forward to Miami further expanding its cultural scen",40,March 2016

The food types have been lowered, at least on my visit, to couscous with a bit of lamb, another larger pot of the same couscous and some sweet potato soup. The other half of the buffet table are some salad items. Additionally, there were no magazines or newspapers to be found. Finally, the mens room was a mess with no toilet paper or tissues and others water glasses left on sink. I expect much more for my now $550 membership fee and so should you!!

With this in mind we wanted to make sure that we made time to visit while in Miami. This was a huge mistake. While the park did offer some pretty impressive views of the Miami skyline, the manmade atoll was disgusting. The water was black and smelled like raw sewage. The smell was heavy in the air and we couldn't even stay long to enjoy the views. Skip this attraction, at least for now.",10,July 2016

Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Theaters,monocotman,Night of the Nut Cracker,"First time visitor to the center. Parking was easy but can be expensive. Try the garage north of the center and save $10. Once inside the architecture is beautiful with towering windows, elevated venues and great seating. I was able to get ticket for the orchestra section that were six rows from the front. This was an ideal location as it was close enough to see all the details of the show but far enough back to where you weren't having to turn your head in each direction to catch all the action. The show was delightful with a beautiful set display and costumes that were vivid with color and exquistely made. The best part of the ballet for me was when the dancers performed with the snow falling over them, it was absolutely beautiful. The show went off without a hitch and ended beautifully. The only issue for me was the seats themselves. I'm a tall man and the seats made me feel as though I was on an airline flight hitting my knees on the seat infront of me. Even the cushioning was a bit uncomfortable for my rear end. But all in all, it was a very pleasant evening and I will surely attend another event at the center. Enjoy!",40,December 2015

The second day we were there the waves had stirred up so much of the muck that was at the bottom that the water looked murky and not as nice as the first day we went. My son did not mind!

It has two different big theaters for opera, ballet, musicals and an intimate black box theater that is just perfect.  The acoustics here are exceptional and the programming is varied and accessible.  I only have one gripe with the Arsht, and that is their bars.  They have the worse barstenders and their drinks are so but so miniscule that they are smaller than the little bottles you get in the planes and at prices that are simply ridiculous.  I was there Saturday and I have always complained about the pours and the bartenders, but after this one time, they lost me.  I will not order any more drinks there -- not worth the aggravation, and I must say we go to the Arsht for concerts, musicals and love their black box.

Just remember to pay for parking when you pay for your tickets. We paid $15.00 for parking lot C and that was completely worth it! When we drove to the theater that night, no one was allowed to buy last minute parking. As we were pulling into the parking lot, several cars in front of us had to turn around to find parking elsewhere. (The people in those cars didn't look too happy.) So, if you're seeing a show here, pay for parking in advance and save yourself the headache. If you prefer driving your car into a parking garage versus a parking lot, the theater does have two parking garages, A and G, but those were more expensive.

The location is small and darkish with good music and blasting AC. They have the tipical bar games such as jenga, connect four etc, and the beer board and selection is very comprehensive. We had a flight, and enjoyed several. As far as the bar staff, can't say that they were especially helpful, they just filled our order, did not ask any questions. Not sure if they offer brewery tours, but it would probably be interesting. They do not serve food, but there was a food truck outside. One of the things I enjoyed the most was that the crowd was VERY diverse. There was the typical younger hipster crowd from the area, as well as older people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and even a couple of families with toddlers (not sure about that but hey, to each its own)...overall I would say its a great hang out with good beer, and if you happen to find great company like we did...even better!",40,July 2015

Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,dtellechea,A must for Craft Beer Enthusiast in Miami,"Craft beer has really taken off over the last decade. I recently moved down from Tampa, where they're now known for having variety of excellent craft breweries. Although Cigar City will always have a place in my list for one of the best, Wynwood Brewing is a perfect example of why this revolution is very much alive in Miami. The father-son story behind WB holds true to that of the American Dream and humble beginnings. The beers themselves are a craft and an art in their own way, with an alternating menu and weekly 'treatment tuesday' release, you'll find yourself contemplating the menu and which beer you'll have next. Personally, Pop's Porter is a must for my first, it's just that great of a beer -  I HAVE to have it when I go. Of course, the highest tribute goes to the staff, Dom, Michelle, Javi and Brit who have always been helpful and attentive on my visits from Tampa to now, that I've moved to Miami and frequent more regularly. #woodisrising Here's to Wynwood Brewing!",50,August 2015

After several beers and talking to the owner, we got our courage up and went for a stroll to take in all the ""art"".  He was even nice enough to refer us to another micro-brewery a few blocks away, named Wakefield Brewing.  Both are good places.  Try parking in their lot.

We ordered a few flights of beer and then branched off to our own preferred beverages. They had two of their most junior staff working while we were there and they were still knowledgeable and friendly. We spent our entire time seated at the bar and talking with them.

The food truck which isn't a part of the establishment at all was delicious. They will even bring you the food into the bar. The area of the bar looks a bit sketch but the entire area is getting built up and pretty much looks like that. ",40,October 2015

Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Theaters,TourGuide-Manager,Arts & Entertainment,Argentine architect Caesar Pelli designed the Arsht Performing Arts Center as the center of the arts and entertainment district. The Knight Symphony Hall to the east seats 2200 and is significant because of its sophisticated adjustable acoustics with 84 concrete panels which open and close at the touch of a button to shape the sound inside the auditorium.

There was security team to check hand bags & pockets for concealed weapons.  Helpful & welcoming staff.  Avoid arriving late for performance in order to find your seats.

Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Theaters,Murnsey,Comedy show,We were excited to get tickets for the Louis CK comedy show here at the  center last week.... our seats wound up being on the fourth level. What I want to say is the acoustics are so bad if you're on that fourth level especially towards the rear of the auditoriumyou should not waste your money. It is so difficult to hear anything. Perhaps if you watching a ballet and don't have to hear someone talking it wouldn't be so bad. I am so disappointed that a magnificent building like theArsht center has such terrible acoustics.,20,November 2016

Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,juliop470,Nice ambient ,My initial impression was of caution when I saw all the graffiti and exterior of the place. That soon changed to a more relaxed and comfortable sensation caused by the people around and the excellent beer. La Rubia is a light beer with body. October fest is a strong body with some delicious sour aftertaste. Lupesta? the new addition was also very good. This is an excellent place to have a great conversation and fun night.,50,October 2016

HORRIBLE, AWFUL FOOD!!! salty, fatty, cafeteria food.","Food- I give it a zero for anyone expecting anything on the menu for healthy eating. --Forget it if you are a vegetarian.  I gave up on that over 2 years ago.  Your membership will get you a cup of non-organic tea.  I love it when I'm told--- we have fruit for you--nothing hot or any food with substance for the healthy minded person. Get rid of the chef/menu director. Sorry, I'm just frustrated and sick and tired of everything on the menu filled with cheese, milk, too much salt, and never anything fresh and clean. Oh yes of course you can get a salad- mixed with an unhealthy sauce. The bottom line is if you are a member the only consideration the chef has given for us is a boring bowl of green leaves.

The lounge was very crowded but you can find good spots down the hallway from the front desk.  I found a sofa there that I was able to curl up on undisturbed.

Wynwood Brewery was one of the first in Wynwood and is one of the best. Beer lovers rejoice! Fun place with a good atmosphere and plenty for you to indulge.

Domino Park,Parks,Jose S,I could sit here for hours watching these people play Dominos,"The name says it all: it's a park for dominos. And those that love dominos. And who better than the older ladies and gentlemen, mostly from Cuba, who sit around the many tables to talk smack to each other, to show you how a true game of dominos should be played. It's an amazing time being out there, even if you're not into dominos at all. The reason? There's a very authentic feel to this place that just makes you want to stick around to watch how a simple game is turned into such an intense experience for the older generation. The people there are lovely and may share a few stories with you of what Cuba used to be like back in the days. So grab a colada, cortadito or a cafecito and enjoy the view of one of the only remaining authentic places Miami has to offer nowadays, in my humble opinion. ",50,July 2017

But it is just a very small, crowded park with some people playing dominoes.  You can't participate and there isn't much else to do.  It is an interesting cultural spectacle, but seeing it in person didn't give me any new insight.  All you're going to do is walk by on Calle Ocho and think ""oh yeah, that's dominoes park"".  They you're going to walk on and have a coffee somewhere.  It's not an attraction in its own right and it's really not worth a trip just to see it.",20,January 2018

In my opinion the Miami lounge ranks last compared to the other four listed above.  The space is very small, and there are very few actual lounge chairs where you can relax or get some work done.  It looks like they have tried to maximize what little space they do have with tables and chairs.  The bartenders were not very good.  The food was decent.  ",30,November 2018
The Centurion Lounge,Airport Lounges,petfoodguy,Too crowded,"My wife and I arrived from a cruise and visited the lounge before our flight.  It was very crowded and we got almost the last two seats in the lounge.  The food at the buffet was good in all respects but, they didn’t have any forks.  When I asked I was told bluntly, “they are washing them”.  So I used a spoon.  Then, there were no coffee cups and I waited on one.  Later I noticed another line for the coffee cups.  I looked at the bathroom and there was a line of 3 coming out of the men’s room.  I went across the hall to the Admirals club.  It was much larger with fewer people.  No lines for the bathrooms.  No lines for the food and plenty of forks and coffee cups.  Centurion would be fine but, if it’s too crowded just go across to the Admirals club.  ",30,December 2018
The Centurion Lounge,Airport Lounges,Navexplore,Crowded with no space,"Visited the lounge while waiting to return to Europe.  After checking in with a rather abrupt desk attendant, I found that there were zero seats available and numerous individuals just standing by the walls waiting for a seat to open up.

As we were there early, the place was not too crowded. However, the lounge is quite narrow which makes it feel congested, and the food is basic and not very inspiring. In fact, we felt this was one of the most lacklustre lounges we have visited on our travels. For an Amex lounge, we were expecting something a little more upmarket. Apparently, the lounge is being closed over January (2019) for refurbishment, so it's a good opportunity for Amex to turn over a new leaf with the place.",20,December 2018

Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,Jaime B,Favorite spot!,"My husband and I were taking a self-guided tour of the breweries in this neighborhood. We began our tour here, at Veza Sur, and we loved it so much that we went back and ended our night there! The beers were delicious and the servers were friendly. The outdoor seating area was large, comfortable, shaded, and had a number of 'big ass fans' around. There was a large Connect-4 game which was a huge hit. The only problem was there was just one. Note to brewery owners: buy more of these large games! The absolute best part of this place, though, is the Peruvian food truck! It was, by far, the best food we had in Miami! We not only ate it for lunch earlier in the day, but again for dinner when we returned. If you hit this place up, come with an empty stomach and ready to eat!",50,June 2019
Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,Rob F,Excellent brewery,The patio on a nice day can't be beat. We visited Veza Sur several times on our recent visit to Miami. They have an excellent and very diverse selection of beers with several light and fruity options for a hot Miami day. The food from the truck parked outside was excellent (the tuna is the best) and super easy because the brewery servers order from the truck for you. Service wasn't great one time we sat on the patio but they were mobbed so it's somewhat understandable. I would definitely return.,50,June 2019
Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,Zookster1199,Veza Sur,"Swung into Veza Sur before a dinner reservation for a beer, we both enjoyed our Mangolinda and Trigo IPA. Atmosphere was great, had a live soccer game on and plenty of fans to keep us cool.",50,June 2019

Frost Museum of Art,Art Museums,Aworkingmommy,What there is of it...,"It's nice to see projects like this come to Miami, but this one isn't complete. The facility is beautiful, with a world-class location. The indoor/outdoor concept is great. But this is simply too much staging for too little substance. Much improvement is needed for this place to be worth anybody's while to visit and pay the high admission prices. The ""planetarium"" isn't one; it's an IMAX movie theater. The movie we saw was just ok, and nothing impressive. Perhaps this place is in it's infancy, with much more to come, or perhaps this is just it. If the latter is true, I'm sorry to say, it will be going the way of other failed Miami projects. Really disappointed.",30,June 2017

Coktails are 2 dollars each as well, the bartender said ""yes"", so we ordered them all without any problems, then in the end when a check came they turned out to have charged my beera 2 dollars each like they said, however they charged my wife beer. Coktails like 6 dollars each, (after he said beer cocktails are also 2$), I didnt want to complain because we had a great time there and the drinks were good, I just wish the bartender was more honest with us about that.",40,September 2019

The little girls got bored if we started to watch one of the many educational videos, so the older boys could not suck up all the great info that the Museum has to offer. But overall the experience was great. We got there at almost 3pm and we had to run on the laste exhibits. Try getting there sooner and with already lunch in your belly (we had had already lunch when we got there). Highly recomended. Oh, one other thing. We were expecting a indoors museum so my wife and I went in pants. Better off in shorts and light clothing. Exhibits are under AC but a lot of things (and all connecting corridors, stairs and elevator) are not. So no pants are required.",40,August 2018

Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,Katiebug T,"Food debacle, unmemorable beer","This was the last stop on our little brewery hop. I honestly don't remember the beer. It seemed ""eh"" compared to the other breweries we went to. But, who knows, maybe it was great and the experience soured it. There was a food truck on site. My friend wanted to order food, so she went to the bar, who sent her to the truck, the truck sent her back to the bar where she paid. We then sat there for a good long amount of time. She went to ask the truck what was taking so long, and they said they didn't have any ingredients left for what she ordered. She'd already been charged, so she had to go to the bar to get her money refunded. There was literally no communication between the food truck and the bar or even to the customers. I've even at many brewery food trucks and have NEVER had this problem. in fact most of the breweries in Austin only have food trucks and everything runs smoothly. I have no idea what was going on with this weird system. I was all panicky and hungry by the time they figure it out, so I was just not a fan of the entire experience. Maybe I could try again, but I probably wouldn't.",20,July 2018

When I received my order the driver brought me like 3 boxes and a bag I ask what's all this he claimed I ordered it I said no just the grinder salad and dessert he said well it is in the ticket so it must be yours so I took it gave him a tip.Looked in the boxes I had 2 pizzas now this is just myself my grinder salad breadsticks and dessert I looked at my ticket and there was no pizza or breadsticks on it the total bill only came to less then 30 bucks I just figured I scored and will give the pizza and breadsticks to my neighbor and when I did they were so happy that made me happy they thought the pizza was very good but we all have different taste and if they had not taken it the garbage was gonna get it.Anyhow I'm just giving this review my opinion and there's some very tasty stuff on dominos online menu I guess I just have to try it all then u can figure out what is good and what is not.,20,June 2019

Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,CityTripLover1,Cute and a lot of beer,"The place was very cosy and there was a lot of choice for the own-made beer. The beer didn't taste very special, but it was night to try some of it.",40,November 2018
Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,jmY3041GL,Great spot,This was really a neat experience. Located in wynwood it is a great activity after visiting several art galleries. I love the artsy feel of this area. ,50,August 2018
Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,latraveler393,Small but fun,We stopped in for a beer on a Saturday evening. Service was good and staff was friendly. Fairly large selection of beers with something for everyone. They also have board games you can play. The place is small but wasn’t very crowded while we were there. If you’re staying downtown I would highly recommend taking an Uber or Lfyt since the neighborhood didn’t appear to be the safest area. ,40,December 2018
Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,M3427FIwilliams,"Small place, no atmosphere, good beer","The beer here is very good which is the most important thing.

Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,amybK8350XW,"Great beers, great food",We went here on a Saturday night.

Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,AreWeHavingFunYet,Great Funky Decor and Delicious Interesting Beers,"We love what's happening in the Wynwood area!  Veza Sur Brewing Co has awesome colorful and funky decor.  It has a great relaxed vibe.  There is a large outside area, as well as a large inside.  They brew interesting beers with a Latin influence.  My favorite was the Arroz con Mango which sounds terrible but it was delicious.  Service was friendly and welcoming.  There's a food truck on the premises.  We'll definitely be back, specially for the beer!",50,August 2019

Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,Scott W,"A pleasant surprise for nationally owned ""local themed"" craft brewery","Stopped by last weekend and really enjoyed this place.   It definitely has a South American/Latin American vibe, not purely a Cuban vibe as many places in Miami.   The beers were all really good and reflected the flavors of the region.   Outstanding was the lulo (naranjilla) beer which was amazing.   We did the flights of 5 oz pours and they give you free samples of other beers if you ask.   Lots of other tropical flavors and all were very smoothly blended.   We sat at the bar and were there around 1 pm and the place began to fill up (inside and also outside patio) around 2.   They have numerous food specials (Peruvian and Argentine/Churrasco seem to be the main ones) but we didn't eat.   Parking is on the street pay by phone parking.   They also have a ""rewards"" club that earns you discounts pretty quickly.   Will definitely go back.   I was reticent to go here due to the AB InBev (Anhauser Busch) ownership but found it to be authentically local.",40,October 2019
Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,darwinmoore,Hipster's delight,"We ain't hip, but we still dug the place.  There were a lot of well-dressed and pretty people in the house at lunch time on a Saturday, along with blue-jean & tshirt types like ourselves.  But, all mingled well and we got good service from our waitress.  They had a nice selection and, a bonus, some creative cocktails.  It's also unusual to see a place feature micheladas.  They were good, but not quite as good as my fave dive bar back home (but I admit the bias).  Very pleasant visit.",40,February 2018

Matheson Hammock Park,Parks,Marshall I,BEST BAECH PARK IN SOUTH FLORIDA,Anyway GO GO GO,50,March 2019
Matheson Hammock Park,Parks,Wanderjahr,Better beaches close by all around,"The marina is decent for launching boats, but the beach is not very good, and there are so many other far better public beaches nearby on Key Biscayne. About the only time you might want to use the beach is when the water on other beaches is cold (winter-spring) or rough, as the little ""atoll pool"" is sheltered and warms up from being so shallow and having reduced flow from the ocean, but even then, I'd probably just skip it and go to a heated pool. The water isn't the prettiest, and they have a nonsensical rule against any kind of flotation device, even a float vest for a toddler. They claim it is for safety, but these are items almost every other public pool or beach in the country allows without incident. Yet another reason to go somewhere else.",20,May 2018
Matheson Hammock Park,Parks,KMilFam,Great for what it is....,"This is the kind of place that is great if that is what you are looking for.

Frost Museum of Art,Art Museums,Stella-Dot,This place is bigger than you think!,"There are so many facets to this museum that you run the risk of missing out of every aspect.  Apart from the works of art (set out on many floors) and practical experiments there was an aquarium, a planetarium and sculptures and vast objets d'art.  Do not forget the connecting corridors.  There are lifts, but you have to wait for those.  A great many families were visiting which I felt was a good sign as it was appealing to the young ones.  The planetarium was brilliant, brilliant - a must for all ages.  You never stop learning!",40,November 2017

Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,ricardocolon,"Good beer, terrible service ","The gripe that I have was the treatment I received from the two waiters.  I was there yesterday with a date.  We ordered the beer sampler with four small glasses, an additional sniffer of beer, and an appetizer which we consumed over a span of about 30-40 minutes.  Since we arrived their body language was indicative that we were not quite welcome.  At first, the waiter suggested I order some additional appetizers, which was fine.  While I said no, I thought at the moment I would stay a while and order more rounds and appetizers.  Then they were constantly stoppingl by to see if we wanted something more from the menu.  That would seem to the reader like good service, except that there was something in their harsh tone of voice, body language, and persistence that made their offerings and suggestions sound more like demands to us to pile more things to the tab.  After that first round, we knew it was time to leave.",10,December 2017
Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Breweries,KarenGilchrist,"Cool bar, good food and beer","We sat there all night. Cool indoor and outdoor seating.

All these older gentlemen playing dominos with such intensity, I wish I could have stayed longer but even if you have just a few minutes, while you finish the ice cream you will have picked up at Azucar( try the Abuela Maria) do stop by, it is so very authentic and reminded me of my trips to Cuba.

The Centurion Lounge,Airport Lounges,markmT9579YA,Don't leave home without it?,"In Miami in transit to Guayaquil, I arrived this morning from a 9 hour flight from Chile. At 4:30am. I proceeded to the Centurion Lounge. Thinking perhaps that I could get a cup of coffee and rest a bit in preparation for my connecting flight. Lo and behold! it was not to be! As a very nice CSR, a lady indicated that I was not allowed in. As my wife is a Flight Attendant of American Airlines and we fly with a Boarding Pass that is Non-Rev category. A they require as ""Policy"" a Boarding Pass with an assigned seat. Note that I have a Platinum Card as required, pay the $500 annual fee for the card,  never had any issues with Amex and used the Centurion Lounges in the same circumstances Stateside and Internationally since I have been a member. So I proceeded to call the CSR number on the card. As usual I got a front line CSR phone operator. Who after explaining the situation to her got a scripted reading on ""policy"". Only problem was she never addressed the question. What is the correlation between a paying a $500 annual fee for a card with certain benefits and not being able to even get a cup a coffee at a Centurion Lounge? Which I am paying for. No answer as besides being coached in the background she did not seem to understand that ""policy"" is not abstract. As opposed being designed by people like her and I. And that someone has the directive delegated ""ability"" to explain clearly to a customer the reasons he cannot have a $500 dollar cup of coffee. It was beyond her ability besides reitarating that it is ""policy"". Whatever that is. Obviously some nearsighted prejudicial idea that allows Amex to pocket $500 on a scam. So ""don't ever leave home without it""! You'll love the results. Smiling CSR's that make you feel you're neither welcome and your money is not good enough.",10,November 2019
The Centurion Lounge,Airport Lounges,Greg M,Terrible new policy disallowing access to inbound passengers,"I travel frequently on business and often on the red-eye.  When I arrive I like to freshen up in the lounge (sometimes even have a shower) to make myself presentable for my business meetings.  Its one of the main reason I even bother with the card.  Have done this for years.  Now, however, due to ""overcrowding"" in the lounges Amex no longer allows in-bound passengers club access.  Why do you even have showers?  For people to freshen up to get on a plane for 7 hours?  Rediculous!  You are killing the business traveler.  If the clubs are over-crowded find a better way to limit the crowds (fewer guests perhaps).  I welcomed the new Centurion Lounges after we lost acces to Admirals Clubs, but now I want nothinh more to do with them.",10,November 2019

The three prior breweries did not have food so seeing the Peruvian food ""truck"" next to this brewery was great although I did not know anything about Peruvian food. I had the chicken bowl with kale and paired it with one of the Veza Sur beers. It was the best meal and it only cost about $20! Service was a little slow so we needed to flag down the server a few times.  As with many breweries, the largest part was outside. It was comfortable  with many large fans.

Dudamel would have done a much better job. This performance was like attending an opening night at the National Gallery of Art in DC (which I have done numerous times) and finding Rembrandt and Romero Britto in the same exhibition. Unforgivable. Marturet bringing together this quasi-Cuban upbeat music and the genius of Beethoven is as Frankensteinian an approach as they come. His audience, clearly, was equally ignorant about the mix and spent their evening applauding EACH MOVEMENT. Something that I had neither seen nor heard in 40 years. Even Marturet noticed and simply laughed at it by telling the audience “applaud whenever you feel like it.” It should have been a clear message, but instead it fueled the abysmal ignorance of the audience. Marturet, cognizant of his gargantuan mistake of mixing the two genres, had a minimal presence of mind of recognizing…and I quote “I know that many of you will ask yourselves what is Cuban music doing with Beethoven…what can I say, it’s Miami!” And with that, he confirmed the irrefutable truth about this Gobi Desert of classical culture: Gloria and Emilio Estefan are the highest exponent of music in this town.

Take my advice if you are eligible go there instead and don’t even think about going to the Centurion Lounge and if you aren’t eligible for the Flagship Lounge then use your Priority Pass to go to another Lounge as even though these aren’t great they are a million times more relaxing than going to the Zoo !,10,December 2019

A lost history of black innovation and perseverance, nicely preserved in this museum. I was in awe and took many pictures. I'm Haitian and was happy and proud to see a picture of the first Haitian Police Officer. I was flabbergasted when I saw the first Black courtroom run by the first Black Judge. Amazing history is an understatement. Thanks United Teachers of Dade, for this great lesson during Black History Month!!!",50,February 2020

Chill place and liked that they had food available for purchase.  Just wish it was a bigger space. Bar can get packed quickly.,40,June 2019
Wynwood Brewing Company,Breweries,DBernard1029,Poor customer service ,"I went to Wynwood to take advantage of their discounted growler fills when they first open. Being an avid craft beer drinker, I own several growlers and brought my own to be filled. I was told they don’t usually honor the discount on growlers other than their own, but would honor it for us. Okay, fair, don’t know of many breweries that do this (can only think of one other), but at least they were going to fill our growler. We picked a beer, and after filling the growler (or so we thought) the keg was kicked and they weren’t able to locate another. We weren’t alerted to the fact that the growler couldn’t be filled so we thought it was all fine. The bartender sealed off the growler cap and gave it to us. At this point we noticed there was over an inch of air at the top of our growler. We pointed it out and the bartender said it should still be fine if we drink it fast. Anyone who gets growlers filled, or knows about how carbonation works, would know that this beer was going to get flat fairly quickly. We told him unfortunately we wouldn’t be drinking it for a few days, as we planned to take it back home with us to the other side of the state. Instead of offering to fill the growler with another beer, or pointing out that the growler hadn’t been fully filled before sealing it off, the bartender waited for us to point out the issue and then didn’t really offer any solution. He went to go look for another keg again, then didn’t come back and talk to us about the issue and instead began working on other things behind the bar. It was very clear we were bothered by the space left in the growler, and wanted a solution, as we had expressed that to him. It wasn’t until we prodded and inquired some more that he suggested we fill the rest of the growler with another beer, which was a very odd suggestion. Ultimately, we ended up asking for a refund, which was given. I don’t think I would have been bothered by this experience had it not been for the lack of caring by the bartender. We were made to feel like we were being bothersome for his mistake. I don’t like to leave negative reviews, and typically can find a silver lining in the experience, but this was just flat out poor customer service. ",10,July 2019

Matheson Hammock Park,Parks,Cheryl2806,Filthy and disgusting!!!!!,My husband and myself visited this park in Feb 2020 and were very disappointed. First of all the beach area was unkept and the water had a smell to it. There were workmen all around as the restaurant was under construction and not open. There was a worker blowing sand off the sidewalks and when he passed by my husband and myself while sitting on our beach blanket in the sand he did not try to avoid spraying us with the sand from the machine. He had no regard for trying to avoid us. My husband told me not to go into the water as it was very filthy and mucky and also had a stench to it. We sat in the sun for about an hour and then we decided that it was not worth our time so we left. This is definitely not  a beautiful place  to go and enjoy a beach and the sand as advertised.  I would suggest to stay clear of this park.,10,February 2020

Frost Museum of Art,Art Museums,scott r,LBGT art (at the moment),"Enjoyed the experience, and the fact that someone curated an exhibit basically of and by (though not necessarily 'for', anyone can benefit from a view) the community.  Striking architectural space.  Make certain you want to see what's exhibited at the moment - interior photos posted here were not the collection presently on view.  Parking is hard to figure out - there is a paid lot with visitor spots, but getting into it is not (!) intuitive.  Sadly the desk clerk did not bother to explain that there's a lot more to see on site than just the art museum itself, and I left without realizing that - bummer, and a little annoying in retrospect / but I had other stops that day, so OK.",40,November 2019

The staff was very educational about the dolphins, their background, species, how they handle them, and how they don’t pressure the dolphins doing something they don’t want to do. You can really tell they mean what they say because when you see the dolphins and how the handlers are with them, the don’t push the dolphins to do anything and the dolphins seem to really enjoy doing the swim. There was one point in the swim where the handler tried to have the dolphin come over so we can pet it and the dolphin did not really seem to be interested in that at that moment so the handler went on to something else and came back to it later when he thought the dolphin may of been ready. It was a great interaction and educational session. Aside from that, the park was very beautiful and clean and had many other things to do.",50,August 2019

Also before we booked they told us one photo would be included with the experience this was a LIE. I ended up paying an additional $135 for pictures and mind you it wasn't all the pictures. The lady that assisted us with the pictures was extremely rude and didn't even try to listen to us. She just wanted to rush rush rush and get us out. I don't understand why photos aren't included they end up throwing them away. Would never go back again. ,10,July 2018

I ordered a few drinks (mainly mojitos) which were very very good. If you take a close look you will notice that they have a lot of Cuban art hanging up all over the restaurant.

Dolphin World,Swim with Dolphins,goatwoman17,Experience of a lifetime!,"Getting to touch a Dolphin has been on my ""Lists"" for a long time. But I wanted to do it somewhere I knew they were being treated well. I walked away from this experience feeling that way. The talk they give you before you are allowed in with the Dolphins is informative- How they live in the wild, what they are doing to help the ocean, where not to touch a Dolphin, rules and the fact that they use Dolphins that seek out human interaction for the encounters. The ones that don't want to be petted get used for their shows with the trainers. I had SO MUCH fun! I loved the trainers they had with us and the Dolphins really did seem cool with humans touching them. The only complaint I had was they had us check into the park 2 hrs ahead of time. If you want to see the rest of the park it's cool, but if you had other things to do, it was an inconvenience.",50,May 2018

If historical places  and churches are your thing, then I highly recommended this church.  Its like going to a cathedral in Italy, just built in Miami.  This used to be an old wood house back in the 1800's.  It was the first catholic school in Miami.back then. This church is not in a good area, Please visit only in the day time and if possible during the weekdays.  The church does open early and its open until 4pm.  There are masses during the week, sat. and Sunday.  This church is located the downtown Miami which has good places and bad places.  Always stick to the crowd when walking.  During the week there are lots of business people, police and protection.  Some places are open on saturday in this area while many are closed.  Sunday not a good idea to walk around this place since everything is closed.  No activities lots of homeless people.  Parking lot can be a problem, you must pay for it.

Coconut Grove,Neighborhoods,RRaposoMiami,Small hip Miami by the water,"Coconut Grove has changed over the many years I've spent time there. Still the Annual Coconut Grove Arts Festival is a must do each winter season. Once a hip and hippy artist hangout area, then a more corporate yet still somewhat hip local. You really have to walk the area to appreciate it. On the north end by the waterfront you'll find the tranquil David Kennedy Park, the as you make your way south along Bayshore Drive you come to the classic Grove restaurant, Monty's Raw Bar next to the marina. It's a must to try specially at dusk to early evening. You can continue south and check out The Fresh Market store, they sell everything in a unique place. There's Dinner Key and the Miami City Commission building next to the waterfront. While some large condominiums dot the landscape, the road if full of palm trees and the the feel of the water. The road ends and turns into McFarlane Rd. right at the historic Coconut Women's Club and Peacock Park. When a block later, the road meets both Main Highway and Grand Avenue you'll find the commercial center of the Grove. The 2 large shopping malls, CocoWalk and Mayfair. Cocowalk is now being remodeled to a more modern looking place. It has features lots of restaurants and boutiques over the years. The more interior designed Mayfair was once a high-end mall, now is mostly a corporate office complex and a hotel. There are several hotels if you want to stay, from the high-end Ritz-Carlton, the Sonesta Coconut Grove, to the less expensive Miami 4 Star Hotel Waterfront Oasis home of the Mutiny, and the Courtyard and Residence Inn, both by Marriott. Both Malls have large parking garages. A walk down Main Highway and you'll get a small feel for what the Grove used to be, small boutiques, restaurants and lots of large shade trees. You can enjoy and outdoor cafe like Greenstreet Cafe or Taurus Bar a little further down. The Barnacle Historic State Park is in this area, a former Victorian estate and bayfront park. On this water side of Main Highway there are lots of small streets with the tropical feel of a small town. If you go a couple more blocks south you can check out the Plymouth Congregational Church and it's lovey stone facade. Some Private Schools are located in this end of the Highway, so avoid it during drop-off or pick-up times. Otherwise it makes for a great drive further south into Coral Gables and Old Cutler Road.",40,February 2019

Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Art Galleries,78JorgeF78,"Loved it the first time, not so much second time","I visited this place with my fiancé a few months ago, we had an incredible time. We decided to go back again last week. We were bored. It was a Friday night and the place was dead. We know exactly why, the DJ absolutely stinks. People kept on coming in and out of the place, they would come, sit for a few minutes and then leave. Why? the music, its horrible. The DJ has no clue who his audience is, he plays music that is not what the visitors to that place want to hear. HELLO, CUBAOCHO? we go there to listen to Latin music, salsa, merengue, bachata. Instead, he plays stuff no one wants to hear or identifies with. I DJ back in the 80s when I was in college and the first lesson I learned is, ""read your audience"", play what they like, if they are dancing, keep playing that style, if they sit down, change it quickly. He does not get that. My advise to management is, get rid of the DJ and find someone that knows about who you are and who the people that visit you are, we are mature, professionals, We don't want to hear Pitt Bull all night, we want to hear Celia, Merengue, Salsa.....also, since the name is Cubaocho, you may want to suggest he researches what Cuban music is like. Also, the bar tenders leave a lot to be desired, the mojitos were inconsistent all night, the first one was LOADED with Rum, the second, it was a lemonade, the third, tasted like a rum and coke. Get professional bartenders and a professional DJ. The service was very good thought. We will return to see if anyone reads this post. There is a bar right up the street that was packed, Ball and Chain.....everyone was dancing and having a good time, everyone in Cubaocho seemed bored. Hey management, pay attention to your place or you wont survive. Its a cut throat business, you are not paying attention to it.",30,March 2016

Breakfast was ok but rather spoiled by the endless stream of construction traffic. The few retail units that were occupied seemed unable to grasp the concept of actually opening their doors - they were supposed to open at 11am and by 11:20am most were still closed.

In 1952, it was headquarters for Operation Pedro Pan, facilitating exile of 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban refugee children.  In 1961, Balen Jesuit Prep was founded.

HistoryMiami,History Museums,mrancer,Great way to spend an afternoon and learn something about south Florida along the way,"We spent a couple days in Miami getting ready to leave on a tour of Cuba and decided that we wanted to learn more about the history of the area.  This museum filled the bill.  They had a special multi-media exhibit on the airlift of children whose parents were sending them out of Cuba to the US in the early 60s and it provided really interesting background for our trip to Cuba a few days later.  We had a long and very informative discussion with a museum curator who answered some of our questions and offered additional insights.  Then, in a separate building, there is a very good exhibit on the history of settlement in the Miami region, from Indians through Spanish colonial times and into the 20th century as Americans flocked south for the sun and Latin Americans came north for political and economic opportunities.",40,November 2015
HistoryMiami,History Museums,Vincent M,Surprisingly Good,"Logistics: HistoryMiami is on Flagler between NW 1st and 2nd.  A GPS is extremely useful, because the museum is bordered on two sides by both a river and an interstate highway; and on all sides by one-way streets.  Parking is available nearby in garages and lots, but their city-center rates are quite steep.  You can save a bundle by finding a parking spot on the street.  Even though you have to pay to street-park, that’s chump change compared to commercial parking venues. The commercial-lot deal-breaker for me was that the garage demanded that I tell them in advance how long I’d be parked—ergo, if I overestimated how long I’d spend in the museum, I’d be paying top dollar for a parking space I was no longer using, and if I underestimated, I’d have to skip some museum halls.  In fact, I would have underestimated, expecting to spend an hour or so, and actually spending all afternoon there, and racing through several halls as the museum was about to close.  The museum staff was happy to let us leave temporarily to reset the meter.   Obviously we weren’t the first visitors who’d needed to feed a meter.  On the other hand, if you do decide to park all day at a downtown commercial lot, you’ll be happy to learn that the US Bankruptcy Court is conveniently located just around the corner from the museum, should you unexpectedly need its services.  My estimated length of visit is more than 3 hours, based on you all being thoughtful adults; I don’t think small children would keep their interest in this museum for that long.",50,November 2015

There was an interesting tour of some of the areas of the permanent collections too.  Several video displays were out of order though.  I tried to take the tour of the Pedro Pan exhibit which originally seemed to be in English but then they switched docents to accommodate two people who wanted it in Spanish so he did the tour in Spanish but not English.

Its owners have collected and restored hundreds of pieces of  Cuban art and they are all on exhibit here.  The art they collect is from the period before the revolution.  It is the art that Castro and his regime tried to erase from the Cuban memory.  Cuba Ocho also holds a Cuban arts library that the public is invited to use.  Drinks are served as well as tapas; however, I would not pick Cuba Ocho as a place to dine.  The owners do have a very extensive list of drinks and liquors such as Rum available.  When I am in Miami, I go to Cuba Ocho mostly in the evenings for the ambience and the Cuban music.  The house band is impressive with many well known and renowned Cuban musicians.

We went during the day so there were only a few people there among us. And that was just by fine by us. In the neighborhood of Little Havana, where everything feels touristy, this place did not.

At this particular time, they have an incredibly moving special exhibition about Pedro Pan - 14,000 Cuban children were voluntarily given up by their parents to come live in American to escape the communist regime.  The largest movement of children refugees in history.  The even handed manner in which the exhibition was built, with no commentary on politics, made it all that more powerful.

Miami Metrorail,Mass Transportation Systems,frez,one trick pony,"The Metrorail inits own it's ok...only if it served a purpose. Let's be honest, if Miami had a public transportation system it would be the worst in any main city in the world!!....the bus service is unreliable, which you would have to take in order to reach one of the Metrorail stations. It is convenient only if you live within a block of a station and work within a block of another. Walking in Miami's heat and humidity is a torture.Miami has bar none the worst public transportation system of any major city I had visited.",30,November 2016

There are historical markers at the church that will add to the visit.  Located on the south east corner of NE 2nd street and 1st Avenue, it is very close to downtown Miami.  There is also a gelato spot directly across the street to enjoy after your visit.  Nearest Metro Mover stop is 1st Street Station just over a block away.",40,March 2015

HistoryMiami,History Museums,Mariemma B,See Stiltsville Key Biscayne with History Miami ride,"History Miami runs sunset cruises tours once in a while to go to see the charming stiltsville and Key Biscayne. You'll meet a local historian Dr Paul George at Bayside Marketplace, 401 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33132. There you'll depart at about 7:00 pm. However, you have to be there 45 minutes prior to register. For two hours you'll enjoy wherever the weather gives you that day. In our case, it was a perfect afternoon with delightful scenery, turquoise water and blue and pink sky and the outline of Miami. During the tour you will learn how this community with floating houses was transformed into the seven houses that remain of Biscayne Bay. Known in the 1940’s, 50’s and 60’s as a playground for wealthy and well-connected Miamians. The Cruise goes by the Cape Florida Lighthouse, while listening to the history of Stiltsville, Key Biscayne and the city of Miami. I would recommend it to a couple  who wants to have a romantic time, for some friends to hung out and to a family or a person in a solo. Just move around the boat after a while to have different prospectives. It cost $60 to non-members. You can find History Miami in Facebook.",50,July 2016

So for that particular trip it’s great. The problem is that it doesn’t cover enough of the city by a long shot. So it’s not an alternative for moving around to different and distant parts of town.

HistoryMiami,History Museums,Toby H,Excellent exhibits!,"We had some free time before our flight left on the day of our departure and were looking for something to do close to our hotel.  We visited the History Miami museum which was comprised of two buildings with separate exhibits.  The primary exhibit provided a great historical perspective of the area and how it developed over time,  They had one of the best collections of artifacts from sunken ships that I've ever seen and I've visited museums all up and down the NC/SC/GA coast line.  The second building housed more contemporary exhibits and an interesting exhibit about how sports helped shape the Miami area.  We spent much more time at the museum than we expected to and found it very interesting.  This would be a great rainy day activity or to fill a few hours before your departure flight.  Admission was reasonably priced at $10 per adult and the contemporary exhibit changes from time to time.  If you are a history buff or just want to learn more about Miami, you will enjoy this.",40,September 2016

I visited on a Bank of America ""Museums on Us"" free weekend and was glad that I didn't pay a cent.  Paying for parking was too much to visit this place.  I stopped to see an exhibit on a not so famous architect.  The curator didn't know what he was talking about, as the work of this particular architect was derivative of several other much more famous (and deserving) architectural icons.  Given how much off the mark this particular curator was with this exhibit, lent doubt to everything else that I saw.  Displays are just average.  The permanent collection is shallow and I felt as though I wasted my time.  Sad Miami!   Miami - you can do far better!   And, the neighborhood in which this museum is located is dreadful, perhaps dangerous.... street people ALL OVER THE PLACE.  Didn't feel safe.

There was a bar, but I was never approached or offered anything.  Still, I think it's definitely worth coming in. There are things I wish I had asked about and hope to return next time I'm in town.

There were some interesting displays but overall I found it underwhelming. Just an overview of history rather than much in depth, or analysis of changes. And I didn't see anything since the 1990s which is 30 years of modern history that's missing. However, it means you can cover it all fairly quickly. ",30,April 2017
HistoryMiami,History Museums,kimg899,Unusual,"There are a few different sections of the museum, the memory lab area was quite strange. It's very abstract and just not our thing. Then there was a huge area of photographs and biographies of ""interesting"" (i.e. Oddballs) people of Miami. The last area was more of the traditional museum and we enjoyed the scavenger hunt. The strange thing was that when we turned in the paper to get our ""prize"", the front desk person quizzed us as if to see if we really did the scavenger hunt or just checked the boxes. I think they should just add the questions to the sheet rather than putting you on the spot. Our fav part was learning to play Dominoes. ",30,April 2017

The fine old lady is brightly painted and the inside is majestic.  The whole experience was eye opening, as the gorgeous details once found on churches are no longer found in modern churches.

Close to other restaurants, and the famous ice shop AZUCAR (Celia Cruz). They have flavors that will blow your mind.  The parking lot is a little difficult.There are meters in the street.

I ride it daily as a commuter and can say that it is safe and generally fast, although occasionally there's a train delay.  Now that there's service to the airport, it has greatly added to it's usefulness.  It's a good way to beat traffic, and usually one can find seats.  The reason I've given it a rating of 4 is that it covers only a limited part of Miami and in that respect is pales by comparison with rail  transit in other cities",40,February 2019

They fled into the Everglades where the government was unable to reach them. A very sad chapter of Florida history.

The main exhibit is on the top floor of the second building which focuses on Florida’s history from the creation of the Everglades after the ice melted to the different Native American tribes which have lived there for hundreds to thousands of years.  On my way out, I asked the girl, Eliana, working the admissions desk a few questions about the area.  She was so insightful about the history of so many things!

Miami Metrorail,Mass Transportation Systems,SUSANA E,We have new trains - but things are always delayed,The trains are now coming as they should - instead of every 12 minutes - they now come every 5 mins during rush hour.  After rush hour (about 10:00 a.m.) all the vagrants seems to ride the trains - some are aggressive - some are on drugs - sleeping on the trains - asking for money.  As to the airport - I would not recommend taking the trains - to or from the airport -again - too unreliable and homeless/criminals preying on tourists.  Please be careful - sadly - Miami needs to revamp its transportation system.  The buses are no better - only during rush hour are they sort of reliable - after that - the vagrants come out.

We wanted to have a real authentic evening out in Miami and had read reviews of other places.  I'm a tourist here, so I can't say I know tons about nightlife in Miami, but if you want ""authentic"" then look no further. People of all ages and walks of Miami life are here, and I'm not even lying when I say everyone is warm, welcoming, and happy to be there.  I'm definitely going to take some salsa lessons when I get home, and when I do travel back to Miami I'm coming HERE.  Absolutely fantastic!  We arrived around 11:00 and things were just starting to pick up, but by 1:00 the dance floor was packed.  Luckily for us we also made it there on a night where local band Grupo N'Taya was playing!  They were super sweet and lots of fun.  It's easily one of those places you could spend all night at.  Muchas gracias Cubaocho for the fine experience xo",50,July 2019

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,RRaposoMiami,Summer Baseball in lovely comfort,"We just visited Marlins Park again for a Marlins v Mets game. The Park is located in the old Orange Bowl site. I recommend checking this place out even if you're not a true baseball fan. It's a great place for tourists to visit from the modern space-ship white exterior to the air conditioned expansive interior. They have moved the entrance areas (for all but Member fans) a bit further to the front of the stadium where you go through metal detectors and have to get rid of any open drink containers, even water. Then you walk over to the ticket checking areas by the actual building. Escalators take you to the main level. Once inside, be amazed by the overall enormity of the building. The Park is enjoyable with the roof open or closed. There are large windows in the outfield with views of downtown Miami in the distance. The Parking garages charge a flat $25.00. However there are still enough private parking lots surrounding the stadium that charge between $10 to $15., some right across the street. The area is pretty safe and there is a large police presence all surrounding the stadium. Inside, the main central walking area goes all around the structure, so you can see the field from every angle including the standing areas in the outfield. From a bobble head case to souvenir stands to caps and jersey stores to virtual hitting area, you can visit all before or during the game. There are quite a lot of food & drink sales areas for different tastes. Many items are overpriced as you would expect at any ballpark these days, however, there are 2 spots that sell several items for just $3.00 each: hot dogs, Pepsi, pop-corn, etc. Perfect for those families with several kids. Otherwise you might pay $14. for a pork sandwich and another $7. for a large water. The regular seats are all chair-backs with arm rests and cup holders in the seats in front of you. If you bring small kids, there are kid friendly areas in the outfield walkway sections. For beer drinking adults there are bar areas and the Clevelander sports bar in the outfield area as well. BTW: You can enter and enter the building from that back side as well. A large outfield TV screen gives you all the player information during the game. Since the park is rarely even close to full, you don't feel closed in or so crowded you can't move. The sight lines are excellent from every spot in the park. The upper deck is mostly empty, and sitting up there gives you a birds eye view of the field. While the Marlins are in a re-building mode in 2019, they are decent enough to give the fans a good game most of the time. Visiting team fans can always get a seat, so it's perfect for them as well. The best thing is the enormous retractable roof which means there is NEVER a rain out and rarely if any rain delay, which used to happen very frequently in the old Dolphins Stadium location. This game in particular was a good one as the Marlins beat the Mets 8-4 while hitting 3 home runs. All four of us adults had a great time watching the game and walking around the park.",50,July 2019
Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,Adam W,Horrid Location,I am not questing the stadium itself but when the Marlins use to play Pro Player stadium there were a lot more fans. Example the St Louis Cardinals triple A in Jupiter sells more tickets than the Marlins. They made a huge mistake moving the team all the way down in Miami because the majority of the paying ticket holders were from Palm Beach County so put on an extra 30 minutes of driving. They should of moved the stadium closer north than south like in Pompano Beach. Yet who wants drive from WPB or Delray just to go to a bad part of Miami just to watch the Marlins? It's the location not the stadium. Move the stadium further north and your fan base will grow,10,July 2019
Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,JimParkland,GREAT Venue but Food/Beverages are EXPENSIVE,"The stadium is really fabulous.  Can't imagine there's a bad seat!  You can also walk around the entire stadium (360 degrees) on Level 1. Beware though, hot dogs are $8, can of beer is $12.",50,July 2019

Parking was easy, staff and ushers were super (and we were rooting for the “other” guys), and traffic at the game’s conclusion was very well managed!  The stadium was ultra cool with plenty of  food concession stands for every taste.  We mentioned it was our first visit to our usher and were presented with “First Timer” buttons.  Our seats were spacious and comfortable and the activities both before and after the game were most enjoyable.  I hope the fans in Miami get behind the team, because their guys played hard and the folks are lucky to have such a cool stadium.  And speaking of cool, there are no rainouts.  If the weather is threatening, they simply close the roof and turn on the air.  We were comfortable throughout the game (t-storms outside). If you’re a fan of the game or just looking for a enjoyable evening out, check out Marlins Park.

Concessions weren't all that great, but being in Little Havana, you can definitely find some great food surrounding the stadium. This is not a knock on  the stadium, but Uber and Lyft have got to get better drivers to pick you up after the game.

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,David A,Truly Coolest Stadium in MLB,"I grew up a Mets fan, but switched upon attending the first Marlins game at Joe Robbie Stadium. Unlike Cubs and Red Sox fans, we got championships quickly, and are now rebuilding. But the stadium is terrific -- built for baseball -- great sight lines and amenities. Even if the Fish are losing, a great time can be had in the on site Clevelander Bar. Plus, the stadium is on hallowed ground -- the site of the old Orange Bowl, sacred to us old time Hurricanes and Dolphins fans...",50,May 2019

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,Dakles,Great stadium but prices inside are a rip off,"We went to see Marlins take on the Pirates and, although the arena was no more than 15-20% full, there is no denying it’s a really good stadium. It is smart, clean and modern throughout and the view was superb. It comes with all of the razzamatazz you would expect from a MLB venue. Our one criticism would be the cost and quality of the ancillary items like parking and food. Parking was $20 in advance or $25 on the day and, frankly, you pass cheaper options on the road close by. Signing for the parking is also poor. We had a ticket for GA parking but there was no signage for this. We had to pull over to ask the police where we needed to be. Food and drink prices are extortionate - $12 for a burger, $7 for a bottle of water - and the food quality is poor. Fries are soggy and lukewarm, hot dogs are small and bland.",40,June 2019
Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,artskillman,Fantastic Ballpark,"One of my bucket list items is to see an MLB game at every ballpark. Marlins Park was number nineteen out of thirty. I spent my entire life in commercial and industrial construction. When I walked in, it took my breath away. It is an amazing ballpark. The food was not the typical generic toxic food like substances that I have seen at the vast majority of ballparks. Much of the food had a Cuban theme, some of which I had, which was very good. The ticket prices were reasonable as were the souvenoirs. Parking was well marked. It is too bad that there ballpark had probably less that 10,000 in attendance. It must be remembered that the Marlins are one of three worst teams in baseball.",50,June 2019

I was apprehended with the idea because I have not visited that area since the 1970;s when I was a teenager.  Then the area went downhill, but it has come back with a furor, and whoever did it, did a great job.   There are restaurants, cafes, bistros, expensive retail stores as well as discount retail stores and specialty stores.  I walked up and down mixing with the free feeling of the people walking around with their children and their dogs.   We had breakfast at one of the Bistros.  The service was excellentm and the orange juice was fresh squeezed.   The area has an European feeling with all the cafes having tables and chairs in the outside.  There was a Farmer's Market in the plaza.   Everyone looked so happy, cheerful, enjoying the nice weather.  I cannot wait to go there again, this time for dinner.",50,May 2016

It has all the stores you typically look look for and need, and even some stores which are sometimes difficult to find elsewhere, for example American Doll (which is huge, even with a place to have ""coffee"" with your daughter and her dolls), Abercrombie Kids, etc.  The mall is the outdoor type, so it is nice and pleasant to walk around, and has restaurants and a movie theater if you want to take a break.  Since it is not the typical ""tourist"" mall, it is not crowded and service is personalized.  It is also not as large as Dadeland Mall, so I find it easier to go with kids and walk around and not be afraid to get lost from your group.  You find plenty of parking space which is comfortable with your shopping bags and it only has one level so not to worry about stairs or elevators. Perfect!",40,July 2015

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,Alex080856,Take me out to the Ball Game! and FAGETTABOUTIT!!! But the great Jackie Robinson.,"I really don't follow baseball anymore except of course when my hypocritical self emerges when my team is doing well. Like so many fans here, I route for the team I grew up with. In my case, the New York Mets. Yes, I was there at Shea the year of the ""Amazing Mets."" I came here to Marlins Park with my sister-in-law only because her second cousin and family were in town from a cruise and to see their beloved Chicago Cubs. I did my usual yelling of ""LETS GO METS!"" even though they were not playing. :) The Marlin fans have come to accept that a good portion of the attendance will not be Marlin fans. Parking is convenient with signs telling you where to park based on where your seats are. The parking lots and stadium are very nice and the staff working the crowd flow are excellent. The traditional baseball stuff like the 7th-inning stretch and singing ""Take me out to the Ballgame"" were my highlights! My tradition is also eating hotdogs, which by the way the only time I eat them is at a baseball game which I seem to be averaging once every 5 years. My hotdog tradition almost stopped. $7.50 for a hotdog and $9.50 if you want it with sauerkraut. FAGETTABOUTIT!!! I bit the bullet for the tradition, but not anymore if I can help it. So I suggest eating before you come as all food is overpriced (although if you are diligent you may find specials) and enjoy the game. My other highlight of the evening was the fact that ""Before taking the field on Monday night, Marlins left fielder Curtis Granderson took a few moments to high-five and shake the hands of 42 specially invited guests at Marlins Park....he headed to the dugout, he individually touched the 42 invited kids who took part in the Marlins’ Jackie Robinson Day tribute. His Grand Kids Foundation paid tribute to the 72nd anniversary of the day Robinson broke MLB’s color barrier while with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.""

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,orangeman13,Nice ball park but the food vendors are the worst.,"I am only writing this review because I am hoping somebody in food service reads this. For the most part the people working at the park were nice and helpful. The park is really nice and easy to get around. All this changed when I went to order food. When your waiting in line the workers will hold up a sign to tell you they will take the next person. So when I went over to order the person took off and never came back. I then went to the next person holding the sign and he said I should have stayed where I was but I told him that she took off and never came back. I ordered the Cubin sandwich and after I paid he came back and said that it would be 5 minutes before I could get my sandwich. I waited a whole inning waiting to get my sandwich and missed a couple of runs. If he would have told me they were not available I would have ordered something else. Later in between innings,  I went up to get a pretzel  and 5 people were standing around talking and no one wanted to wait on me. I could not believe that I had to interrupt them to get my food. If someone in customer service sees this Please do something.",40,April 2019

The Falls Shopping Center,Shopping Malls,MiamiScubamom,Outdoor shopping at its best!,"This is my favorite outdoor shopping mall.  I love the waterfalls and how the river and pools run along the entire length of the mall.  Macy's and Bloomingdales are the anchor department stores.  There are many other stores in between, The Apple Store, American Girls, The Gap, Gymboree, Bath and Body Works, and much more.  There is also a movie theater and many restaurants for all budgets.  The lights at Christmas are spectacular.  ",50,April 2015
The Falls Shopping Center,Shopping Malls,Linnea P,Outdoor Mall With Typical Mall Stores,"But the best time to visit in my opinion is at Christmas time when all the decorations and lights are up. The weather is better and not so humid as it is an open mall, but the crowds can be quite bad. I usually will go to the Bath and Body Works sales and that is about it. Sometimes I may browse in Hot Topic. Macys can have some good sales, but I rarely find anything worthwhile buying. I tend to visit every time I am back in town, but I wish there was more variety of stores.",40,December 2014

The Falls Shopping Center,Shopping Malls,Analurivera,Excellent shopping expirience!,"The Falls has most of all the stores you need in an outdoor mall. The mall is nice and it's not so crowded, excellent for stress free shopping. The down side is that since is open air when the climate gets hot you feel it. Also when it rains really hard you are most likely to get a little bit sprinkled. But all in all is a great place to shop and hang out.",40,May 2014
The Falls Shopping Center,Shopping Malls,MrMiamiExplorer,Open Air Shopping,"The Falls Shopping Center has always been one of my favorite malls. It is an open air mall, which gets its name because many of the shops are centered around man-made ponds, streams, and waterfalls. These waterways were filled with bright koi fish when I was little, but have since been chlorinated. There is nice landscaping around these waterways as well. Often you will see ducks wander into the mall from the canal behind it to go for a swim in the chlorinated ponds. I hope they don't drink too much of the chlorinated water. It is a nice place to walk around and window shop, or just sit by the waterways and talk. Unlike the open air shops of Bal Harbour, Sunset Place, or Bayside where they greedily charge a fortune to park, parking is free at The Falls! It is however sometimes a nightmare to find parking on weekends. You may have to park at the far back of the mall (South Side). Another negative is the rudeness and unprofessionalism of the security guards. On more than one occasion myself and my friends have been stopped and/or harassed. Last year a security guard stopped us because he said it was suspicious that we were walking around and texting! Seriously? Many I have seen are very obese, and I have seen them use scooters just to get around. In my opinion the current ones should either be terminated, and/or required to take a mandatory class on customer service. I visited the Fresh Market on this visit and was surprised that the prices for some of the produce wasn't as bad as I'd heard. The Fresh Market is located on the same property and is fun just to browse even if you don't need any groceries. The market's interior is decorated like an old time country general store. I've brought many people to the Falls, who had never visited before, and despite the negatives, will keep coming back.",30,June 2014

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,thevuzoo,Boring!  Like an over-rated high school game!,"We’ve visited many many baseball parks around the country. This park is one of the worst in terms of excitement, fan participation and energy. The park looks well maintained but I felt like I was watching a bad high school game. The team and the fans had low energy and no pride. I’m surprised that they had cheerleaders at the game!  I’ve never seen cheerleaders at any baseball game.  But the cheerleaders weren’t good at all - they seemed like second rate performers. This stadium also plays a lot of Latin music.  ",10,August 2018
Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,CasualHockeyFan,Bottom 1/3 of all the MLB parks,"Having been to almost all the MLB parks I have a good grounding for comparison. On the plus side, Marlins Park is airconditioned, so in the FL heat, this is a good place to escape. As a ballpark, the food is above average compared to some of the other stadiums around the league. The staff were very friendly, but the seating was just okay. The atmosphere was lousy as not too many people show up to watch a mediocre team.

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,OhioSharky,1st time ever,"We went to see the Miami Marlins play while in Florida, July 2018.  1st time ever to a professional baseball game.  The game was fun & exciting.  It was entertaining to say the least watching everyone interact especially while the cameramen were videoing the fans.  This stadium is air conditioned so you may want to take a sweater just in case!  The park and surroundings were very clean and the employees were energetic.  The parking and tickets are cheaper during the week than the weekend.  The only complaint that we have has nothing to do with the ballpark.  As I said, we went in July and we are still getting billed 3 months later for the ""toll road"" round trip from Hollywood, Florida!  If you plan to attend, you may want to try another route to avoid these charges, if possible.

Before we went we looked at all the reviews and decided that it was in a good area with security guards around the place. We decided to stop off on our way to the airport. We left our car for 40 minutes and when we returned it had been cleaned out. All of our suitcases had been pulled through the smashed drivers window. The car was less than 50m from Macys front door yet there was no vidoe footage as apparently according to the security guards there arent any video cameras there. I watched the security guards who ride around on bicycles but not through the carpark just around the perimeter of the shops. We met another customer there who had bought a TV and put it into his car at the same Mall when he came back the car had been broken into and the TV taken. He and we, were sure we had been watched as the windows in the cars were blacked out. this was not a one off incident in this Mall and they need to take security more seriously.",20,April 2013

Marlins Park,Arenas & Stadiums,KFCincy26,The nicest and cleanest stadium we've been in,"We were visiting South Florida and decided on a Marlins game since we'd never been (yeah, we know they are very good this year).  We were VERY impressed.  Beginning with the seat prices.  The four of us sat about 10 rows from the field at the end of the third base dugout for less than $100 total!  The food we had was quite good and I was shocked that they had free soft drink refills with the souvenir cups.  With tickets, a couple hats and t-shirts, food, and parking, we got out of there for just over $200.  Every staff member we encounter were very friendly and seemed generally glad that we were there.  Lastly, Marlins Park is the cleanest stadium of any sport I have been to.  The concourse was impressively spotless as were the seats, bathrooms, etc.  The retractable roof was closed making very comfortable inside compared to the 95 degrees outside that evening.

It took us 30 minutes once we got off I-95 to get to the stadium, and another 45 minutes to get to the centerfield garage.

Port of Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,trek4cs,Very Large Port for Cruisers,"Give yourself extra time to get to this port and have your driver or taxi find your cruise ship departure point.  There are 8 cruise ship berths at this huge container and cruise ship terminal.  Once at your cruise ship departure point, there are lots of porters to take your luggage and point you in the right direction to the main building where you will get your cruise ship card for boarding.  I  try to arrive at port around 11am, before the crowds start arriving from their flights on the same day.  I always fly into Miami a day early before my cruise to ensure there are no hiccups arriving at the port for the ship departure.  Tip: Stay the night before a cruise at a hotel in your price range that offers you free shuttle from the airport to the hotel and have the hotel book you a taxi to the cruise port the next morning.  The cost of a taxi from airport hotels to the port is around $30.  There are a limited number of hotel choices that offer a free shuttle to the port and often the ones that do have a free shuttle have filled up their first shuttle to the port by the time you book in to your hotel. It isn't worth the hassle of their free shuttle to the port service.",40,February 2020

While the stadium is generally not very crowded, it was very full for this game. We purchased our tickets directly through the Marlins website. We purchased them in February and were able to get seats behind home plate for face value. If the Marlins are playing a team which has less of a draw, you can probably get tickets at a better price through StubHub or a similar website. Because there were many people in attendance, the traffic around the stadium was quite heavy. Be sure to allow extra travel time. We pre-purchased parking through Vivid Seats - it was an annual ticket holder's parking pass. We paid $25 and parked in the Home Plate Garage - covered parking steps from the stadium entrance. The stadium itself is very nice and the food options are great. Be sure to check-out the Taste of Miami section. We had delicious Cuban sandwiches. Lucky for us, the Yanks did win - in 12 innings.

Port of Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,brownthrasher,1st voyage on Horizon,"I find cruises to be a good fit for my idea of fun: reading, resting in beautiful indoor or outdoor settings to watch the sapphire blue water, people watching slow walks around the outer deck.  Stateroom 1250 on Riviera (1st floor) is an interior.  It is what I can afford as a solo traveler.  Room was sorted out and cleaned at 11am per my request.  Sadana was a conscientious room steward.  The thing I liked best about him was that he didn't feel compelled to check on me frequently. I have had too many cabin stewards that would knock on the door, which I can't hear, and then just open it… And catch me in an embarrassing state of little attire. I'm not five; stop checking on me. This fellow was very mature and didn't feel the need to treat me like a child. The ship has a variety of dining choices with everything from pasta bowls to Lido fair and of course the main or my time dining. It's been almost exactly a year since my last cruise. Fabulous fun for kids of all ages in Camp Ocean. The food at least on the Horizon, I don't know if it Is so on other ships, is too uppity for my tastes.  I am a boring American that wants plain food. Strawberry soup was as adventuresome as I like to encounter.  Entertainment was top notch. Definitely a lot of attention to sanitation everywhere.  In my time dining if you order the prime rib be prepared to hear it moo.  I couldn't stand to look at it it was so rare. Build a bear is wild.  About 250 showed up for a madhouse.  Tiramisu is highly recommended.  I enjoyed my six day cruise very much, and will probably try to do another cruise sometime this year.

Do go upstairs in the house - the bedrooms and baths are very authentic to the time, and many items owned by the family are still onsite (or have been returned to the house).  Gardens aren't as extensive as Vizcaya, and mangrove boardwalk was still broken when we visited.  Do walk to the Chinese bridge about a mile from the house.

From this photo, we were under the impression that there would be some close interaction, but that is definitely not the case. We were excited to purchase monkey food to feed the various monkeys through special feeding tubes and hanging food dishes that the monkeys have learned to manipulate for treats.  There were to be three shows during the afternoon and each turned into disappointment.  The first show was to be the ""Crab-Eating Monkeys"", diving and swimming to collect food-- the monkeys were ""called"" but only four monkeys appeared and none went into the water.  The second show was to be the ""Lowland Gorilla""-- they have only one gorilla in captivity and when he was ""called"", he never did appear, which was very disappointing because he is otherwise off-limits for public viewing and is only shown during the show time.  The third show was to be about the 150 monkeys in the ""Rain Forest""--  they had wagons full of food, and when they ""called"" the monkeys-- not one of them appeared.

It wasn’t fun to spend a couple of hours waiting to board with no information, but that was not the port’s fault. I got to experience two different terminals. I arrived at one very early and spent a few hours waiting outside. There were tables and chairs and lots of port personnel around, so it felt safe and comfortable. The staff even suggested some good nearby places to go for breakfast. The new RCCL terminal was very big and easy to transit through... lots of staff around. The only issue at the older terminal we went through (C I think but not sure) was that they used baggage carousels like in airports and it took me a while to find my bags!  I think there were six or seven ships in port each day we were there — so lots to see... and the surroundings are gorgeous. It’s easy to get to the port and there are special capped cab fares from the airport, so it was relatively straight forward and easy to move through.",40,December 2019

You have many transportation choices to get to and from the port. Be aware, there is a cheap way to get a bus from the port to the airport ($16 for 2 people), but make sure you ask when the bus is due to arrive and if you have a chance to get on the next bus since you might be waiting for 1 hour. Another advice, if you are renting a car you can book your car at the airport and get a free shuttle from the Port of Miami to all airport's car rentals, you would need to show the shuttle driver your car reservation email. Uber is also a good choice, you get Uber for $18 to get from the airport to port of Miami both directions, avoid Luxury and Van Ubers that will do the same for $50+. ",40,December 2019

Jungle Island,"Nature & Wildlife Areas, Zoos",ChiefGuru,Spectacular Adventure On Watson Island Florida - A Hidden Treasure,"Jungle Island, formerly Parrot Jungle, is an excellent eco-adventure park on Watson Island, Miami, Florida.  Watson Island is just East of Miami and (via bridges) connects Miami with Miami Beach.  The location was originally Pinecrest Gardens, when purchased in 2002 to relocate Parrot Jungle from Pinecrest, FL.  The location was renamed to Parrot Jungle Island in 2003.  Ultimately, in 2007, renaming again occurred this time to Jungle Island. The association with parrots is easy to understand, as these birds are pervasive when you initially enter the park. I will share that this can be a popular venue.  As a result, crowds can exist. As out-of-towners, we are not aware if better parking options exist or not. I share this as we drove through their parking garage (inside and roof top) a couple times, as well as the outside lot across the street from their rear, when we arrived around 10:30 am. Nothing was available.  We asked the garage attendant, however, she did not understand English well and we did not speak Spanish.  Ultimately, we tried the garage again, went to the roof top and (like many others before us) parked in a no parking space. When we left the park at roughly 2:00 pm, the garage and its roof top area were mainly empty of cars. I infer from this that mornings may be the busy time for the park? Regardless, the parking situation, we enjoyed the park. Four adults and a three year old - fun was had by all.  Of course, much of my joy was watching the three year old look at everything in wonder. He especially liked holding and having his picture taken with the parrots, the animal petting portion of the park and the ""jungle gym"" playground. Hard to imagine that this park was significantly damaged by Hurricane Irma in 2017, as it looked great when we visited. As befitting its name, this was like walking through a jungle.  The vegetation was tremendous.  Even though the park is already an excellent time, a number of construction projects were in process when we visited. I am sure the park with only gain interest when these are complete.  Jungle Island has a great selection of birds, mammals and reptiles to see.  Additionally, they have two regularly scheduled shows: Winged Wonders Show (featuring many different birds) and Wild Adventures Show (featuring birds and reptiles).  Both shows are included with admission. They were both entertaining, especially the Winged Wonders. Other areas of Jungle Island, such as Adventure Bay, Superflight, Escape Room and Treewalk Village, are available at an extra cost.  Also, for an extra charge, available are VIP animal encounters: Lemur Interaction, Sloth Encounter, Flamingo Experience, Capybara Encounter or a VIP Private Tour.

Port of Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,HonestWills,Review of Cruise Terminal A (Royal Caribbean),"Disembarkation was an utter catastrophe, a Mile long queue for taxis, no proper signage for Taxi and Uber Ranks. Our Uber driver pulled into a Taxi lane and the most rudest, inappropriate member of the traffic team was shouting and screaming at us to get out of the way, we started loading cases and he pushed me aside and threw the case out. An armed member of the Police went and had a quiet word with him after witnessing the ordeal. My girlfriend was in tears and terrified; The Uber driver was forced to drive down to the end of the terminal with the boot open and our cases sitting loosely in the back meaning we had to follow behind putting my whole family at risk of being run over. We will be going legal as a result. What a horrific way to end our cruise with Royal Caribbean, utterly shocking...",10,November 2019

Once he got in the line, which consisted of 20 people...the employee stopped the line and when the people asked why she said because the people who had passports were more important/priority than the people standing in line to verify their birth certificates. Mind you her job was to handle just the people who had birth certificates. I wish I would have witnessed this because I would have got her name off her badge. My fiance said a lot of the people in line were very angry and couldn't believe an unprofessional comment came out of her mouth. We only had that one issue on our disembarkment. ",30,December 2019

Metromover,Mass Transportation Systems,MARIO J T,'Overway',"One of Miami's peculiarities is to have a combination of 2 unusual trains that make an attempt to relieve the city's awful traffic. Miami has the characteristic of having a morning rush hour car caravan to the East where most jobs are and an opposite return home caravan to the West where most residential areas are. This is where the 1st train called Metrorail starts its job. Leaving from the deepest South West suburbs, this elevated rail rapid transit system runs and have stops with parking lots around the whole city and people who hate getting into traffic jams, park their cars and take the train to their jobs mostly in downtown Miami. To complete the system, there is another smaller train called the Metromover that runs along an inner downtown circle near the coast, so it not unusual to see people take the Metrorail and then board the Metromover to get to their destination. Even though you're not going to work, these 2 trains offer any visitor a good, cheap and fast way to get to know beautiful Miami, connect with people and experience something new",50,October 2019

Occasionally you will see a homeless sitting on the steps of the station entrance. The service was pretty fast ~5 mins and there is a timer in each station. Also lets you know which train’s destination so you don’t take the wrong loop. Miami is great for free transportation infrastructure! ",50,November 2019

Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,Mario P,Interesting and well managed!,"From a 13 year olds perspective, the children’s museum was average fun, paying 40$ for me, my brother and my mom. I would definitely say that the museum is for kids of ages 3-10 years old, since if you are smaller than that, you wouldn’t really be able to understand all the things there are to see and be able to take part in limited amounts of activities. If you are older than that, and you are going with just your parent/parents there would not be that much to enjoy since most activities are designed for smaller children. The only activities you would enjoy, are the more strategic activities like the maze or the learning about the value of money and the arts and crafts section. Mostly, for kid between those ages, they should have fun, and learn during all the kid-friendly lessons, like the supermarket area, where kids go around with a kid sized shopping cart, picking up plastic food and putting it in your cart, and then pay at the cashier. The supermarket is only one place out of a lot of places in the museum to provide fun and lessons about nature, food, money, electricity, recycling, and many more.",50,January 2018

Once was when I waited for a tour bus.  I arrived early, not knowing how traffic might affect my Lyft ride.  I was able to find a Starbucks open, even though the shops were not open yet, because I really wanted some coffee!  I enjoyed sitting on a bench watching people and the two roosters who were ""talking"" to each other from different sides of the marketplace.

Well they brought him out as the final guest animal and my life was made!!! He was so incredible, my obsession with chimpanzees grew so much when I met him, and for the first time ever I got to see one up close. He’s adorable and like a little kid, and the staff was so kind and awesome for letting him give me a high five at the end! So yes this place is a must do, for any animal lover.

Port of Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,Cristina H,Cruise Disembarkation bus loading location is DISORGANIZED and INACCESSIBLE to families with small children!,"Cruise disembarkation day from Port of Miami to MIA Alamo rental car center:  The loading area is lacking in organization, class and respect.  The rental car center buses do not have a set spot for loading- it is haphazard in a few numbered spots.  Since there is no line areas this creates a mob frenzy when the bus arrives which leaves those of us with small children and many bags unable to brave the mobs of people without risking arms, limbs etc.  Alamo sent its smallest buses on the busiest port day.  There is no code of conduct here eventhough we tried to form a line- the line was soon dissolved once the next bus arrived due to lack of space.  We waited for over 1.5 hours for a bus and finally made it on the Alamo bus.  The port of MIA and Alamo need to make the boarding process more efficient and organized with special mind to families of small children.",10,March 2019

We were all told the tour would start at 11am and it was close to 11:30 before I finally asked when the tour would begin and the employee I asked seemed confused that we had been told a start time of 11am. Once the tour guide arrived it was clear he had no idea how many encounters had been booked for that day and he seemed concerned that he was solo that day and so many had been booked.  Also, we and another group had booked an encounter with the sloths and none of the employees had been told they had been moved to another location due to the cold weather and it was unclear if we would be able to do the encounter.

Basically it saves unwanted pets that never should have been pets in the first place! Firstly this is not  repeat, not a zoo.

You get up close but still at a safe distance to several big cats, including the endangered Florida Panthers.

Also Food@Science (the only dining on-site) was somewhat pricey and took 45-60 min.  Best to bring a bagged lunch and snacks.  We felt the free 25 min.  show on planets, sun and stars was just OK.  Tips: Check to see if your local museum has some sort of free admission reciprocation.  Save $2/ticket by buying tickets on-line the day before.  Skip the long line by buying same day tickets on-line anytime. If staying in Miami for a few days, by the city pass and get multiple attractions for one prices.",40,April 2019

Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,"Observatories & Planetariums, Aquariums, Science Museums",buddhakouri,SCIENCE by the Bay.,"The new Frost Museum is a modern marval, located next door to the iconic Perez Art Museum facing Biscayne Bouleavrd, this science musum is much bigger than the nearly a century's old museum in Coral Gables. It is more high-tech, and its near the water and the skyline of Downtown Miami. Its not like your typical science museum in your city. This is more of an open air museum. This museum was more about the fish, lasers, the planetarium, and the airplanes, and the wild animals and plants from the Everglades more than anything else though. It doesn't have that dinosaur exhibit anymore, like the old one had, and it didn't have that high tech dance floor the old museum in Coral Gables had if you've been to the one in Coral Gables before the new one opened. There's no place to learn about the weather either. I just wish the Frost Museum would have those things. But unlike the old museum, a lot of families, schools, and kid's want to come here all the. Barely anybody wanted to visit the old one in Coral Gables. Well, now that Frost has moved to the new location, right in touristy Downtown Miami, everyone wants to go to this museum, and it is always crowded. Better try to find parking, or if you want to come, use Uber, Lyft, Taxi, or bus to get here. ",40,July 2018

It is a big space within in the museum itself having all sorts of interesting and thoughtful (I liked the virtual aquarium a lot where you could color a fish and scan it putting it into the aquarium) attractions on 2 levels as well as a big playground outside. Some of the things did not work 100% but most of it did. Parking is kind of limited,  especially on a rainy day make sure you be there very early or spend some time waiting for people to leave.

There are aquariums, health tests, music and art room, with a great floor piano- my favorite! You can easily spend 3 hours there without noticing.

She's 1 years old but there is a baby area, a blue foam bricks building area that is good for her.  As she gets older she will be able to participate in more things.  I don't think children over 10 years old would find much to do.  We also went for a Mini-Monday for smaller children and some of the activities they provided for little ones were not age appropriate like mini golf (she could barely hold the golf club and definitely couldn't hit it).  The only other bothersome thing is the parking.  It's $1 an hour.  Can be a surprise the first time you go.  It's better to download the parking app and add time if you stay longer instead of trying to prepay and end up overpaying or getting a ticket.  There is a Subway restaurant on site and the prices are reasonable.  That was a nice surprise for a food location attached to an attraction.",40,February 2017

We happened to go on the first weekend of the month and it turns out it was free for Bank of America customers so that was an added bonus. The only draw back is that the only food option is subway and the food and service were both terrible. There's nothing else in the area and you are not allowed to bring food.

Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,"Observatories & Planetariums, Aquariums, Science Museums",Ramón M,An architectural wonder but seriously lacking in visitor engagement and exhibit interpretation,"I should preface this review with a disclosure that I grew up in Miami during the 1970s and 1980s, and so my review may be tinged by a sentimental attachment to the old Miami Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium. Notwithstanding my love for the old museum, its undeniable that the Frost is a world class facility and a major architectural upgrade. My teenage daughter and I had a pleasant enough time there, and we learned a couple of things about the earth's climate and materials science. It was also gratfiying to see the place full of young summer campers, scampering around and interacting with the hands-on exhibits. The Frost has done a good job of making its exhibits fun and accessible to the younger set. The aquarium, with its signature ""Oculus""  is marvelous, and the view from the 6th floor observation deck is breathtaking (I'll have more to say about the observation deck in a minute). However, the experience overall left me feeling as if important elements of a world class science museum experience were missing. Namely, almost no staff were assigned to engage visitors and provide interpretation. During our three-hour visit, we were engaged by only one staff member who was tending to a species classification pop-up.  Over the course of three hours, I saw no other staff tending to pop-ups or otherwise providing any type of exhibit interpretation. Meanwhile, we were approached by two staff members trying to get us to take goofy photos for sale. This is not, in my opinion, an optimum use of human resources in a science museum. A second source of disappointment has to do with some of the programming that the old museum strove, in its modest way, to provide that the new museum does not. Namely, the old museum had a broader mandate to display exhibits on the cultural anthropology of South Florida and the peoples that inhabited the region. This is completely missing from the new museum. This gap is a missed opportunity to connect the new museum to the place it resides in and the indigenous people who inhabited the very spot the facility sits on. The gaps in science coverage at the Frost felt more and more glaring the longer I ambled through its four buildings. Zoology and evolutionary science, genomics, meteorology, geology, physics--where were they?  Even the tiny selection of planetarium shows was a disappointment. And perhaps here is were my sentimentality really weighs in. The old Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium was one of the leading US institutions in providing astronomy outreach to the public. We cannot bring back the great Jack Horkheimer, but there is no shortage of outstanding educators who could have been hired to restore the Frost's former glory days of astronomy outreach,  that is--if the facility had been equipped with an outreach observatory. As I walked the perimeter of the expansive 6th floor observation deck, surveying all the empty space up there and the broad horizons, I thought of what could have been. Downtown Miami may be as light polluted as you can get, but light pollution has no effect on views of the moon, the planets, and double stars. Even a modest outreach observatory--like the one the old museum had--would have been a great resource for the community and a fine opportunity for public engagement. Hopefully, the Frost's finances will allow for consideration of an observatory as a future add-on.",30,July 2019

There was a nice show there (Thomas the train) which was - again - nothing but really nothing special, and the museum in general felt the same way. 2 stories, several themed exhibitions, there was a Halloween crafts activity, which were all nice. A good place to spend a couple of hours with your kids, but if you're only in Miami for a couple of days and want the kids to have an experience they'll remember, there are better options around.",30,October 2016

It was more than $100 for my family of four to enter this most disappointing of museums. Sure, the kids had some fun drawing animals and scanning them onto a big screen. And they enjoyed the remote-controlled boats. But the animatronic dinosaurs were amateurish and the overall experience falls well short of justifying the price. Instead of wasting time and money here, I'd go to the Rainforest Cafe at the Sawgrass Mills mall: they have better animatronics, friendly staff and they'll even throw in a delightful meal - all for less than the Miami Children's Museum.",10,July 2017

Miami Trolley,Tramways,GasperExplorer,Bad service,"The free trolley service seems to be a great idea but in reality, it does not operate that well. There is a schedule but based on the frequency I can probably reach my destination at that time by walking instead. It also does not seem like they ride completely on schedule because we were waiting at the station at the time when it should have arrived but it did not. About 10 minutes later there was one that just drove past the station and on it it said out of service. That happened to us a couple of times and since we did not spend that many days in Miami we decided to walk or use other kinds of transportations to get where we wanted",10,March 2019

In fact the Trolley system doesn't cost anything as it is free. The trolley bus has different lines so you have to change from line to line to really get around the city. Maps of the network are available on line and from tourist information offices. The trolley bus stops are marked with the palm tree logo with the name of the line below. The stops are very frequent. All the trolley buses have the line name on the front. The seats are wooden and can be uncomfortable if you sit on them for a long time. A downside is that the different routes are not integrated and run independently in different neighbourhoods.,40,March 2019

I was there with my 3 little boys aged 4, 7 and 9.  They all had a lot of fun running from station to station.  We had planned all along to eat lunch there assuming there would be something better than there was.  There was a very tiny Subway with a long line and minimal seating.  The tables had trash and food on them.  As I was watching an employee make my sandwiches, another employee started feeding her!  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Neither seemed to think this was odd at all.  After all, at least the employee making my sandwich wasn't feeding herself, right???  I looked at the man behind me in line and he was also shocked.

I would suggest, the museum is perfect for kids until 5 - 6. But still, when 8 you will still find things to do. Except the playground, everything is indoor. Nothing really, where you child get's wet, so no need to bring extra clothing, even water proofed jackets are available for some of the activities. If you have been to the children museum in Vancouver, you will find this museum smaller but it is still big enough to spend 3 - 5 hours here. By than, your child is ready for a break. Lot's of interaction, learning by doing and hands on equipment. We all had fun and it was a great attraction. One thing you need to consider: 20 USD per person plus 1 USD per hour parking.

I went to the elevator and asked if that was the elevator for the Fire Walk and showed my handicap placard. He said, ""This elevator is for disabled only! Go that way!"" There was a fight.

Our group was so dissapointed in the whole museum. The ""hand-on"" activities were either broken or didn't work properly. The aquarium was so poorly lit that we couldn't see more than 15 feet and the water looked murky, nothing like the billboards and advertisments. They have all small unimpressive animals. Then because of bad weather the kids couldn't do any of the rooftop activities, like pet the stinkrays. This is South Florida! Why would you make outdoor activities based on weather. Also, most of the lunch seating is outside and since it was pouring, well you get the picture. We were very unhappy with our visit.

Next, the museum is dark and loud and it was crowded on the day I was there. Many of the exhibits were just ""screen"" activities, which wasn't particularly enriching for my 2-year-old.

The facility was pleasant enough, but the port staff members, while friendly, were disorganized.  One person would tell us to do one thing and another staff member would come along and tell us to do the opposite.  Perhaps their issues stemmed from our ship arriving late, thus complicating the embarkation process, but things could not have become more chaotic.  The view from the port is certainly great being located so close to the city, but the traffic was challenging as well.  We parked our car with Safe Cruise Parking and found it to be just as advertised.  We'd use them again to save lots of money over the Port of Miami parking garage.  I hope our particular departure from the Port of Miami was unusual.  While I would not avoid a cruise that departed Miami, I won't be in a rush to use this port in the future.",20,April 2019

Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,"Observatories & Planetariums, Aquariums, Science Museums",RRaposoMiami,Interesting displays and cool architecture,"We went as a family to the museum for the first time on Saturday. We parked underneath and walked to the east end of garage and upstairs to an outdoor cafe area only to find out that isn't the way in. We had to walk back towards the middle of complex to find the Ticket booth and the main entrance. Better signage in the Garage would help. Tickets aren't cheap, they run almost $29.95. for Adults, with $2 less for Seniors or if you buy them Online before you go. Ages 3 to 11 pay $18.95. Kids under 2 are free. You can buy Memberships, but they are pricey unless you plan on visiting regularly. We had to pick one of the 3 Planetarium Shows to attend, we chose Journey to the Stars which plays in a medium sized auditorium with comfortable seats. The show itself on the universe was interesting, but nothing special. The shows play at different times, so you have to find one that meets your visit time. To go from Level to Level there are Elevators near the middle of the facility. We visited several exhibits featuring an aquarium with all kinds of colorful tropical fish. There's also an Everglades open area with birds, reptiles and sea rays, some of which you can touch. The main Aquarium if one you can see from top and from the bottom, it's full of small fish and some large sharks as well, it's impressive. The Jellyfish smaller tanks are some of the most interesting ones to watch. The MeLab area is mostly for younger kids to enjoy. Make sure you visit on a nice weather day so you can enjoy the Observation Deck on the top Level 6. You get magnificent views of the surrounding park, downtown Miami's tall condos on Biscayne Blvd, The Arts Buildings, the AAA Arena, Biscayne Bay and Miami Beach. There's a Science Gift Shop near the entrance with all kinds of souvenirs, mostly for kids.

So I followed the arrow but nothing said exactly where to go. As I was outside noticing there was no Peoplemover I looked up online how to get to the rental car center. Finally, some actual directions, but it said I have to walk a quarter mile just to get on this thing. So I started my hike. Of the 5 or so moving walkways on the way to the Peoplemover at least 2 were not working. The walk area beside the moving walkways can accommodate 2 people walking side by side so you end up getting stuck behind first time travelers walking like they are the only people traveling.

But it doesn't flow very well & is a bit chaotically arranged.  At first glance, you'd think it'd be huge.  Alas, it's much smaller than it appears.  Parking was $8 for the first hour and then $4 for each add'l hour.  The food in the cafe was very good though.  We had a burger and chicken nuggets, both with fries.  Both were piping hot & the burger with caramelized onions was surprisingly delish!  Admission was $30, but veterans get in free!  One planetarium show is included with regular admission.  To add it to the free veteran admission cost $5.",30,November 2019
Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,JokkeNu,Good place ,The place is great and a lot of different things to do. Worth a visit. Minuses : felt like several things closed or not working.

Zoo Miami,Zoos,cmdevlin64,High-Quality Enclosures & Interpretation,"We enjoyed a full-day visit to Zoo Miami. Throughout the Zoo, enclosures were large and naturalistic. Signage was good and in some cases gave background about the specific animals on display. At least one example of nearly every species was visible (though they could retreat off-display at will). We were especially pleased with the two talks we attended. At the bear talk, keepers conducted health checks for the two bears (very interesting to watch) while a volunteer provided information about bears' habitat and behavior. At the koala talk, keepers Josanni and Garin were knowledgeable about not only the koala and tree kangaroo but other nearby species such as the hairy-nosed wombat and singing dogs. They answered both kids' and adults' questions well.",50,December 2019

The positives: fantastic space, good sightlines, friendly and helpful staff. The negatives: food disgusting, in terms of both quality and price; and the basketball game turned out to be very boring, with too many fouls, stops, starts and ""dance entertainment acts"". You have to question any sport that has to exhort its spectators repeatedly to ""Scream"" or ""Make Some Noise"" or ""Clap Your Hands"" and replays ""We Will Rock You"" riffs endlessly. Most spectators chose to talk and eat and drink rather than focus on the game, so not much atmosphere!",30,December 2019

Also a monorail system that travels the whole zoo. We paid for the additional monorail and one each animal feeding. Fed the Rhino and Giraffes. Never did use the monorail.

And not everyone speaks Spanish.","The trolley is a free shuttle service , the brochures are general maps and there are street signs at the bus stops. However, the brochure says your driver is your ambassador and will tell you if this is the correct bus, either once it is stopped, if it's so jammed full like the Collins express you can't even talk to the driver, or he waves at you like he'll speak at the next stop. The problem I had, as an English speaking US citizen, was most of the drivers weren't English speaking. So, you can imagine how the non English tourists, who didn't speak the language of the trolley driver were getting on.",40,September 2019

I had his picture, vehicle and license plate on the app.  He refused me, so I had to request another driver.  The same thing happened.  Halfway in the port they disappeared and another driver was requested automatically.  I spoke to this driver and he said he had never heard of Zone 8 and was being sent out of the port.  He finally found me and got me picked up and to the airport after waiting 45 minutes.  Other people were getting Lyft drivers so I don’t know what I did wrong.

Port of Miami,Points of Interest & Landmarks,Hialeah73,Easy process to get through Security and Employees Wonderful!,"Very easy process, all very organized. I would say leaving a car that you drove to port in one of the parking lots on or off site was the biggest issue. Allow plenty of time to park and wait for a shuttle. Ours had a very long line of people waiting. It took the shuttle bus several trips before it was our turn. This part was a bit stressful with your family waiting at the port. If everyone dropped off the traveling partners at the port. Then parked it would move faster. As many of the delays in getting the shuttle was 6, 8 10 persons traveling together all trying to board the shuttle. If it was one or two persons per family it would be better. Also, upon return there again was a delay that can not be avoided as they need to have more shuttles since whole families ride together to get the car.",40,October 2018

For the price of this one, I expected more.  Many of the areas had broken or missing items so that they weren't functional and this included much of the Lion Guard traveling exhibit that was a feature during this visit. The dental/medical area was actually worn black from use and needs desperately to be cleaned and replaced.  Like others, we were disappointed in the hyped ""sand"" exhibit which was merely a sand table that could not accommodate many children and left many of the younger ones screaming in anger that they could not reach/fit because of the many older children that were eager to do the activity.

This from a person who has walking problems, next visit I’ll rent a scooter. I was with a friend and we spent the day the whole day there. There was so much to see. The zoo is well planned out with different zones from around the globe, Asia’s, Australia etc: The animals were in very big compounds and free to roam. You can feed the giraffes if you want.

It is very BIG distance wise but I love that because the animals have decent size habitats. I walk it because I want the exercise and its still the best way to see the place. But for those that have problems getting around there is a monorail, tram and pedal carts that can be rented. This place is value for the money, I have seen smaller places priced the same and if you have kids you can spend all day here. It took me 4 hours and that was only stopping twice to have a snack and drink. If you have kids there are several play areas where you can take a break thus making a day of it. This zoo has many animals and you will surely come across some that you have never seen before. I would definitely go in morning and get the bulk done before it gets warm, I fortunately have gone here in the Dec/Jan months so have never dealt with the heat. Great place for the whole family!",50,December 2019
Zoo Miami,Zoos,smallwoode,Great family day!,"What a wonderful zoo here in Miami. We had read lots of other reviews on here that recommended getting a bike to get around- we now absolutely agree it is the best way to do the zoo which is very geographically large. We decided to get one right away as we entered. We got the larger one that held our entire party of my husband and I, our 3 and 6 year old and my 70 year old parents. You don’t have to pedal to ride which was great for my mom who is shorter and had a hard time reaching the pedals. We decided to go to the back and do the amazon and Africa sections first working our way back to the front. Had to get out to walk through the amazon which was fine and then we rode our way through Africa and Asia able to stop and watch the beautiful elephants, giraffes, lions and more. In the span of the 2 hour rental we saw almost all of the zoo and only had a few sections to do at the front area after. Amazing animals, beautiful grounds. Great family day. ",40,November 2019
Zoo Miami,Zoos,littleone1118,Huge Disappointment,"This has to be the worst zoo we've ever visited!  After paying $25pp admission, you absolutely must splurge on the Safari Cycle ($26 for 2 hours for a small cart) or there is no way you're going to make it thru the entire zoo.  Sadly, we were unaware of this and there is no other location to rent the cycles except at the front gate.  There is minimal signage and the map stinks.  So forget trying to navigate to any particular place at any particular time.  We literally could not find the bear exhibit until the presentation was over!  The exhibits are spaced so far apart and half the Africa loop has absolutely nothing to see.  Then half the animals on the Asian loop are African animals!!  Most of the beverage stands were closed and when we finally found one that was open, the Icee machines weren't ready at 12:30pm!  We barely got to see any animals at all and many seemed to be in enclosures that weren't appropriate. Of the 3000 animals they claim to have, I'd be surprised if we saw 30. The Oasis Grill served mediocre food.  The burger was as cold as the lettuce and tomato on top.  Two sodas, burger, chicken tenders and 2 fries cost nearly $30.",20,November 2019

It was 34.50 for each of them and then $75 required of me to be present.. I do think doubling the price for an adult that is “required” to be on site is highway robbery. Our guide for our animal just kinda put the cub down and didn’t give us any type of instruction. We had to figure out how to get him to turn certain ways she just wasn’t informative or helpful with the picture taking... it was cool for the kids to experience but even them as teenagers were a little thrown off by the lack of input. It would be cool if they tell you what the cubs do and do not like . Also they did not require us to sanitize our hands before holding the cub which during covid I would think they would be a little more protective of the animals.

Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and entertaining as she cracked jokes with her assistant lemur, engaging the children and asking if they knew the animals before she announced them. The tour generally takes an hour to an hour and a half in which concludes at a rest area in the park where were allowed to handle live animals with our guides assistance such as parrots, snakes, owls, baby alligators and lizards. Awesome experience for the kids and entertaining for adults as well. Afterwards we got to engage with a live lion cub (at an extra fee of course) but so worth it as we rarely come to this part of the redlands.

I had no idea the grounds of the zoo would require more time and a mini form of transportation. The zoo has the option to rent safari cycles. We rented the large cycle to accommodate our family. It was definitely needed to cover the zoo and much faster. We got there a few hours before the zoo closed and didn't have time to do the monorail ride. My kids enjoyed the petting zoo with the cuddly animals. My recommendations are: go early to cover the entire zoo. Wear comfortable footwear, bring a hat for this Florida heat and a possible poncho.

The carparks are easy to access once you know which one is best for you.  Best place to park for a cruise as it's very convenient which you do pay for but worth every cent to me.  It's important to remember that there can be over 5,000 people on one ship so that's a lot of people looking for taxis and shuttles.

American Airlines Arena,Arenas & Stadiums,Jadybugs,Nice arena,We came for a raptors game and enjoyed the arena.  Usually I always buy tickets in advanced and usually they go down so this time I waited.  Big mistake.  Dumb on my part as it was a Canadian team playing during the holidays when there likely were a lot more Canadians.  Oh well.  We ate at the asian place which was great but I wanted to alter a meal so my husband could eat it as he is celiac and they would not make any changes so he had to go to the mexican place and have nachos instead.  Kind of too bad.  All I wanted was rice vegetables and a fried egg but they said no.  The stadium was easy to get out of which I thought might be a little difficult but I was wrong.  We just called an uber to the mall next to it and all worked out great!,40,January 2020

American Airlines Arena,Arenas & Stadiums,berroacda,"First park, then enjoy","The Miami Heat are having a tremendous season, so is nice to visit the American Airlines Arena, home of the Heat, to feel the hot. But the first is to have a good parking, just to go in just to left. They are expensive in the way how far it is. So if you are early you can’t take a 15 or 20 buck parking, walk a little big,  but when finish you can leave easy. The stadium is easy to go especially if you have your ticket by internet. They are not cheap. But if you want to enjoy you better pay a good ticket, or probably can enjoy special saloon, like Bacardi, but in deep I can’t tell you about. Probably the game will be full house, so try to get ticket in first or second deck, in the third; you probably will enjoy the game in the screen and is not funny.  Is a real spectacle, enjoy.",50,January 2020

Metromover,Mass Transportation Systems,Peter G,Great way to get around Downtown Miami,Miami has made a very good effort with the Metromover and moving people around certain areas. It is by far the most efficient way to move between Brickell and Downtown Miami given the difficult in parking in both areas. I have also taken it to go to certain events at the University of Miami (Watsco Center). It isn’t perfect but getting better every day.,50,December 2019

Bayside Marketplace,"Points of Interest & Landmarks, Shopping Malls",chris6net,Average ,I went here with my wife and 2 cousins. I was visiting from New York. The marketplace itself was nice but there were too many homeless people on the outskirts. What really annoyed me was an employee who was selling some type of boat tour. She was talking to me in Spanish when I don’t speak a word of it. This was a licensed tour company. I finally asked the lady to not bother me by talking Spanish and she said in perfectly fine English that she thought I was Spanish. Ridiculous for a registered company.,30,March 2020

Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Zoos,K7473PBbillyd,Worst experience ever,"I was given incorrect information regarding the time length encounter i had.  i was told i would have 30 minute encounter then 30 minute walking around. instead, i had a 2 minute encounter and then that was it. they told me i was finished with my visit there. i explained my situation to 2 people that work there and no one did anything. they told me they would email me something before going there and i never got an email from them.",10,June 2020
Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Zoos,MichaelLev77,Somewhat misleading,"Rather disappointing.  I booked the encounter with a lion cub as a birthday gift for a friend.  Based on the phone conversation, we expected it to last around 30 minutes (they told us the general tour would last about an hour and then they said to earmark another 30-45 minutes for the encounter).  In reality, the encounter lasted 3-4 minutes at the most.  The keeper was rather short and rushed, and within 2 minutes started asking us to wrap it up.  You can't hold the cub, you can't pat it on the head, so you basically get to watch the cub in close proximity for 3 minutes, ask a couple of questions and take a couple of pictures.  At the cost of over $350 for two people it felt very anticlimactic.  I feel that it was basically a donation to support the foundation rather than a ""purchase"" of something valuable or exciting.  I'm ok to donate, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time.  The general tour was good and the guide was very fun and friendly, but the encounter was a downer.  In a way, I have mixed feelings complaining about it, because I love animals and I feel that maybe the cub gets tired from all the visitors and suffers.  If that is the case, perhaps, it  would be better to cancel the encounters altogether.  But if you keep doing them, you need to set realistic expectations, because as it stands - it feels rather misleading.",30,July 2020

I'm so impressed by this port that I will be sailing out again in a few months.  Granted the cruise line I was on, the ship was very small so it had a limited number of passengers which made things much easier.  Lines that have ships with 4,000 or more passengers, I can imagine it is longer to get onto the ship and through the various processes to get onboard, but from everything that I saw they know exactly how to keep things moving and regularly do this so its no big deal for them.",50,August 2018

The Zoo is very big and need good walking shoes and a good bottle of sunscreen, Florida Sun could kill you. They are building a Water Park next to the Miami Zoo which promise to be a delight for all ages, the Miami Zoo will own it, so probably they will make a bridge or walking path between the two parks.

Zoo Miami,Zoos,Mommytwofour,Beautiful Zoo,Well maintained Zoo. Such a large selection of animals to see. The volunteers are so knowledgeable and eager to share their passion for the animals.  There are two feeding encounters available... giraffes and rhinos.  We didn’t do either do to the potential thunderstorm in the area.  There is a ride that takes you on a “airboat Ride” along a couple animal exhibits. You get splashed with water at a couple points along the way .  What better way to beat the heat. They have a monorail that takes you through the park and the option to rent bikes made for four to explore the zoo too.  Multiple locations for food. They have a slide for kids that goes through the otter exhibit and  tunnel through the alligator exhibit . Total hit for kids.  Midway through the zoo they have a water play area and dry play area for kids all under screen cover . Definitely would say dress the kids in their swim suit and bring a towel.  They also have peddle boats you can rent for the lake area .   They have a petting zoo area to unfortunately we didn’t explore this due the rain. Definitely is a 4-5 hour day or more depending on the heat.,50,July 2019

Why did i even come here i had an extremely miserable time driving the bike was a huge pain and the seats were so uncomfortable. I could have gone to the Super Bowl experience and i do not know why i came here instead of going there. This was one of the worst attractions i have ever ben too Really not worth The Money!!! if you want to see Animals  and have a good time than i advise you to go to Disney's Animal Kingdom because that is what i am going to be doing from now on or even Jungle Island.

My disappointment is that the monorail is ""temporarily"" down (which upon seeing any part of the decrepit monorail my guess is that it will be far from temporary).  I paid quite a bit extra for 3 tickets because someone in my party has a problem with walking and then find out that riding option is closed. The trams that are supposed to be the replacement aren't on any schedule that I could determine and rarely saw them. So I had to pay extra to rent a bike mobile which is hard peddling on hills and must lock every time you stop.  They should make it known that monorail is out of question on this site. Do not bother paying extra for this and then end up paying again for another form of transport. Ugh!!!",20,February 2020

The new building for Royal Caribbean is beautiful and was a great place to wait prior to embarking on our cruise. The main problem with this terminal would be the design of the roads to handle the amount of traffic coming into the terminal. On embarkation day, traffic was backed up and it took almost 30 minutes of waiting to get close to the terminal to get dropped of. On the day we got off the ship, it was chaos in the area where passengers would wait for Uber/Lyft. The area is very small and people were on top of each other. It was just as bad for cars trying to get in to pick up passengers. If you are leaving out of this terminal take note of this and allow time for drop off and pick up.",40,October 2019

Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,Drosa77,Museum ok ,This is my second time coming to this museum and while the museum itself is a good time for kids everything around it is annoying. The parking situation is horrible . They have one parking ticket dispenser so if someone can’t understand what is going on your waiting forever. You need your plate number so I had to go back to car to get it - then when you get the ticket you have to go back to the car to put the ticket in it. So annoyed before I got into the building. They don’t allow food or beverages and the only place to eat in that area is subway - nothing grosser than subway. And the day I went the playground and rock climbing wall were both closed. So again the museum itself was cool. Staff isn’t very helpful or friendly but place is clean and there’s lots to do. The stuff  parents have to deal with like parking and food was the reason for the lower rating. ,30,August 2019

Zoo Miami,Zoos,erickasmith2020,What a disappointment!,"We drove almost an hour to visit the zoo. Stood in line for about 30 min, not a big deal. After paying $50 for my husband and myself we entered the zoo. Went straight to rent a bike. Was given a clipboard to fill out a form while in line behind about 40 people. 45 minutes later we are told by the single person that is working the booth that the credit card machine was down and we can go to an ATM on the premises to get money and get back in line. At this point there were more than 40 people that were in front and behind us. Meaning we would have to go to the back of the line after the ATM. We decided to leave and try to get a refund. Spoke with a very nice young lady (didn't get her name) who tried to help us. She took our tickets and went to speak with someone. When she came back out she told us the only thing they can do is give us passes and directed us to the front to speak with Esther (manager) and she would help us. Explained to Esther what we had just gone through and she said all they can do is give us passes since we already scanned the tickets to go in ?!?!? Not to make a scene, we took the tickets that, we were told, are good for 1 year. Ok, no problem, we'll come back. We get to the car and notice the date on the passes are December 2019. So, either Esther doesn't know what today's date is (March 1, 2020), or she doesn't know there are 12 months in a year.",10,March 2020
Zoo Miami,Zoos,scott r,It is a good zoo - but if you opt for extras it's expensive,"Not an espeical zoo fan, but I had a free day and enjoyed walking the entire facility.  Monorail is (one of the many) optional extras; not necessary - and probably a time waster - if you are in even half decent shape.  Wide variety of animals, covering most of the 'must see' types.  Stumbled across keeper feeding the African elephants, giving a presentation.  Watched the giraffe and rhino feed - visitor participation, but again more $$, enough just to watch those who did.  My own best personal interaction was with a duck of some sort that seemed intent on challenging me to a bill fight; hopefully it was as amused as I was.  The animatron dinos seemed to interest - and slightly frighten - some of the small kids.  Food prices are insane.  Nice landscaping, clean restrooms, clear paths and plenty of water & cool mist stations.  You can even smoke on grounds in deisgnated areas which surprised me, although I don't begrudge giving people the opportunity since a full rotation will take 4 hours or so - what the heck.  Even the base admission isn't cheap - but if you explore everything (3+ miles of path, exhibits placed pretty much continuously) you will get your money's worth.",40,March 2020

Last year we spent 10 days in Havana Cuba, and this place is NOTHING like that. It's just a collection of touristy restaurants with a little local Cuban color thrown in for a couple of blocks. You can walk the length of Calle Ocho for several blocks and find nothing of interest, just touristy restaurants. Seriously, don't waste your time here, there is so much more to see and do in Miami.  The most interesting rstaurant had live chickens walking around, which made the place feel like real Cuba. We visited it for that reason alone (the food was awful)!

So many great buildings and galleries to see, with outdoor art as well. The shopping is ultra high-end--we couldn't afford much at these places! But if you've got the means, I bet it's a great shopping experience. Tom Ford, Gucci, Van Cleef and Arpels, Max Mara--you name it, and the brand seems to be there.

Miami Design District,"Art Galleries, Neighborhoods, Shopping Malls",City1974,This is my favorite outdoor mall.  Period.,"What can I say about this amazing outdoor mall.  It is so nice and such a pleasure to frequent every time I go to Miami.  Not only is there world class shopping but excellent eateries as well.  The appeal of walking around in the great Miami weather, going into  excellent shops and dining at wonderful restaurants is just to much to pass up.  The LV store is my fav in the mall but there are so many other great shops it’s a close call.  Gucci is impressive and the Hermes building alone is amazing, although the customer service isn’t.  If you haven’t been here go, and while your there treat yourself to lunch at Michaels Genuine.  You won’t be disappointed.  After lunch grab a latte at the rooftop Dior cafe.  It’s ridiculously overpriced but oh well, it’s Miami and it’s worth splurging.  It’s best to take an UBER or Lyft to the mall as parking is horrid unless you want valet service.  But go, definitely go to this wonderful outdoor shopping mall",50,November 2019

There is supposed to be a star saying you are here to help with navigation but on most of them there is no star so you don't know where you are.

Little Havana,Neighborhoods,Marilyn A,Very lively,"Little Havana is truly only about 2 streets, one of which is all small stores and restaurants and the boulevard which is treed and planted with plaques and information about the fighters in Cuba.  That was to my mind the most interesting section of the area as it taught me some history.  The main drag had stores of different types - both souvenirs, art, LOTS of cigars and the usual clothes etc.  Given how SPanish Miami has become, this was not all that different from other sections.  Much more down to earth though and less trendy I think,  FULL of people and very active.  Lots of restaurants to choose from,",40,December 2019

Brickell City Center,Shopping Malls,cuse_41,Beautiful mall,But expensive!  This is a fairly new multi-level open mall with many high end stores.  It is an attractive space to walk about.  There are a number of very interesting restaurants scattered through out.  When you tire out you can take in a movie at the CMX.  The CMX theater has  lovely recliner seats and serves food inside the theater during the movie.  The food is very good and the service is excellent.  It is as luxurious as advertised.  While expensive - we enjoyed treating ourselves to the movie. Parking is a bit outrageous.  But it is the price you pay for a visit to this Brickell area landmark. The Metro rail has a station stop on the second level.  I am not sure what it will be like in the summer since it is an open mall. We came for the Gelato Festival and most likely the only reason we will come back again is if they have a special event we want to attend.,40,March 2019

Parking is impossible on the street, but garages are cheap ($3 for 4 hours).  Neat place to wander - hard to believe it was once basically blight.  At the moment I'm on a budget, but even if I hadn't been, the clothing / fashion stores would not be on my list.  Fun to see, but it's clothing for g-d's sake; jeans should last 15 years and sneakers for 5, lol.  The art on the other hand, might have tempted me; just not this time.  Lots of visual interest though, touches of whimsy - and plenty of food.  A neat area for an afternoon.",40,November 2019

Best food and best people.  You have to be a part of this culture while in Miami.   They make the best tobaccos.   Ball & Chain has a live band, but it gets too packed on the weekends.  The food is amazing at Cafe La Trova.   There are so many restaurants and bars to pick from.  Also, you have to watch the people play at Domino Park.   They play dominoes very competitively.

Connecting three city blocks while creating a beautiful spacious walkable indoor/outdoor four level mall in the middle of a dense city is laudable. Very ambitious and classy. Shops and restaurants are upscale with some at every price level. The three level La Centrale Italian Food Hall is worth a visit on its own; some what like Eataly in NYC. Anchor store is Saks with many specialty shops. Lots of families and kids and great eye candy. Parking is a crazy, hard to follow maze with one dead end forcing a turnaround. At 3 bucks an hour, not gouging. Bottom line, you should see it. Not a huge mall like Dadeland or Aventura but a gem. ",50,August 2018

You can see Cuban men actually playing the game Domino in the park-a traditional game popular among many Latin people.  There, in Little Havana, I visited a Cuban coffee and tobacco-cigar shop, and a Guayabera shirt shop.  There is even a shop where cigars are made by hand.  Although, the United States of America still does not permit the sale of Cuban cigars, you may purchase other made cigars from such countries as the Dominican Republic and other Latin American and Central Latin American countries, there in Little Havana, Miami, Florida.. This is a very educational, interesting, and cultural trip.  I highly recommend this trip/visit to Little Havana. ",50,August 2019

Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,Stephmlb,"Overpriced, poorly maintained facility",Decided to spend a rainy day at the children’s museum. A lot of the exhibits were broken or not accessible to children. Seemed quite run down and dirty. The only place for food was Subway and the staff there were incredibly rude to us and other customers. We left with the thought we would never be returning to this museum.,20,November 2019
Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,Agingwell711,Fantastic,Went with my 3 year old granddaughter.  It was completely interactive!  We stayed 4 hours and probably could have stayed longer.  Be sure to get an activity schedule when you come in.  Military discount is half price!  There is a Subway on site.  The only drawback was parking for which you must pay although it is not expensive.,50,November 2019
Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,frand776,Great time with a toddler,"On a day too cool for the beach, during a 4-day visit to see my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter in Miami, my daughter and I took advantage of “mini Monday” at the children’s museum. It was our first visit and we were thrilled with the exhibits. There was so much for a very busy toddler to do! From the fishing boat to the art and music games to the model supermarket to the building and construction unit, we were all kept engaged for hours. There is a Subway restaurant for lunch. The souvenir shop was also a big hit with the baby who loves poring over books as my daughter read to her. The next day the baby asked to return to the museum.",50,December 2019

Some elements were not working,  and the pricing is a little high, especially for a 19 mo.  However, there was something for kids of all ages. We loved the music wing, which was highly interactive.

Miami Children's Museum,Children's Museums,gods4me86,Day of fun,"We have never been here. I've lived in the area for 6 years an have always wanted to go. My girls are 8 and 10. They had more fun running through each level and looking at each station , more than actually playing in them. They were amused by each area an thought it was cool but they only played in a few areas. We were done in 2 hours. If they were ages 5 to 7 or so , it prolly would've been more fun interaction for them. They had fun fishing , jumping on huge floor piano , the slide , and shopping in the small publix and making me suns at the little deli. They ran through most of it. Their favorite part was the rock climbing wall. They spent like 20 to 30 min there. There was no line. It was 4 dolars a kid. That was a good price I thought. It was fun an cute but I think mine would've had more fun at the science museum cuz of their age and their interest. After the 2hiurs of running through it and basically skimming by each room, they were ready to leave for chuckie e cheese. It was nice. I didnt think it was run down at all. I didnt think anything was unclean. It looked very well.kept up with. Nothing was broken that I noticed even though we didnt do too much interaction. But I thought it was really well done. I'm sure if you're from a huge city this may be small for you but this was our first time ever at a children's museum so I have nothing to compare it too. They had 2 different outdoor playgrounds. One is by the entrance and the other is only entered through the museum's door , inside the museum,  just for the other playground. ",50,February 2020

Miami Design District,"Art Galleries, Neighborhoods, Shopping Malls",ResidentePermanente,Great reno of a formerly-abandoned area,Not an easy place to shop. Better to know what you want and where you're going. It's more like a village of stores than a shopping mall. It still feels like it's in the process of development as many spaces are yet to be occupied. Everything from Hermes to lesser-known brands and individually-owned design/concept stores. We had the names and locations of the places on our must-see list and then enjoyed discovering other interesting vendors. When it's hot or raining it would not be a comfortable ahopping trip as all businesses are accessed from the open streetscapes.

Every luxury watch manufacturer except if you want the best selection of Richard Mille you need to go to Brickell City Center and ask for Alanna. She is truly the best.

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,neonphil,Nice Gardens and Beautiful Setting but Need Audio Tour to Appreciate House,Orchids were very unique and gardens around the house were very nice.  We spent $22 on each ticket (sort of expensive I think) and did not do the audio tour which you need to tour the house.  There were a few plaques around the place to read but not many.  It was crowded the day we went (Saturday).  We went in Feb and the gardens had some color but not too much.  It was a nice way to spent a couple of hours before we headed to the airport.,30,February 2020

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,claude o,"Italian renaissance style house with elaborate gardens,by the ocean","The Vizcaya museum is comprised of the main house and formal gardens. It was built in Italian renaissance style by a successful businessman, James Deering, in 1916. The  main house has more than 30 rooms decorated with original, opulent furniture from that period, mostly European and Chinese. It is also equipped with modern technologies at that time like the telephone, heating, ventilation, and so on. The house opens in the  back through grand stairs to a walkway and to 11 acres of formal gardens dressed up with fountains and urns that are interesting to discover. A small orchidei garden located next to the cafe shop is worth a short stop.",40,January 2020
Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,KC4444,Our 2nd time.,"Tips-Go early-when they open and tour the house 1st as it gets crowded as the day goes on.  Also, you will have better parking and not have to park across the street-believe after walking around the house and gardens for 4+ hours you will appreciate having transportation close by. The audio tour provides more information and can be hear better than the guide tours that fight to be heard in the crowded area.  The audio also allows you to go at your own pace and is of both the house and garden areas.  You can get a senior discount in person but not online.  The bathrooms are located in a building by the side of the mansion.  If the line is long, there is also un-marked bathrooms if you walk down around the corner before entering the gardens - that were always open when we ran into a waiting line.  We were here about 10 years ago and the place is just as beautiful as it was then.  The only difference was the increasing number of professional photographers and Quineceanera girls getting their pictures taken - also had to laugh at all the people doing selfies and not just enjoying the beauty of the place.",50,December 2019

Wynwood,Neighborhoods,shatterah,Art Deco urban street ,Nice place to take a stroll. Crowds are fairly young so you get a mix of all walks of life. It has plenty of places to eat or drink.

To the contrary, if you are visiting downtown Miami, the drive west to the Mall on weekdays if you head that way after 2:30 pm because you will be caught up in horrendous traffic.

The gardens are big and designed to pull you in with the sense of discovery. you keep saying '""What's that over there?"", and going in further. There are side gardens, secret gardens, ponds, fountains, bridges, balconies, a canal and docks over grown by mangroves. It took 4 hours to see the entire estate less than an hour was spent in the house. Tip: Keep a sharp eye out near the barge I spotted manatees there!",40,January 2020

The neighborhood attracts artists and has plenty of galleries, showrooms, boutiques, cafes and restaurants.  Go and enjoy its laid back, counter-culture vibe before gentrification takes over.

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,wendjay,Beautiful,"I have lived in south Florida for awhile now but have never ventured to see this place. I finally did and I found it well worth the money and trip. The main house is by far the best part of the whole tour, with a great inside into south Florida’s early years. There is a nice view of Biscayne Bay from the rear area of the residence.  The reason I dropped a star on this review is the garden. While very elaborate and decorative, it was not well maintained.  The greenery was healthy but the fountains and ponds suffered. Some were green and full of leaves and some were completely dry. I was a bit disappointed as I’m sure at it’s full glory this places is a site to behold.",40,January 2020

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,SayCheese,"Handicap, senior visitors","Thoroughly enjoyed our visit! Arrived at 10:30 on Friday, they only had one wheelchair accessible. So bring your own. Only the first floor is wheelchair accessible. For elderly, they will need to walk up two flights of steps to the second floor. No elevators. Make sure to do the tour of the house. Was 1.5 hours and moved slowly through each of the rooms on the first floor. The guide brought it to life, and pointed out many of the artifacts and history of the home That we did not pick up walking through on our own. Never felt overly crowded, though the tour groups will jam the rooms. Our group had 15 people. For people who cannot go up and down steps, there is a lot of this outside as well. But if they are mobile and can go slow, they will see most everything. The café was delightful, but everything was pre-prepared and packaged in plastic containers. Prices range from $10-$15 for salads. There are no shuttles from the parking spots to the front door, so you may wish to drop people off before you park the car. Very glad we all came, and enjoyed our five hours. Veterans get in free with ID.",40,January 2020
Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,Lisa C,Expected more landscaping,This is more about the residence and ocean location than the gardens and landscaping which was sparse.

It was the most cost effective and time saving, ie  30mins.    Bus is cheaper but takes a couple of hours.   We love the mall as we have been before, this time the Micheal Kors had a massive sale on and so did Guess.     There is a huge variety of stores and has something for everyone, including so many labels but not just labels.   The food court was just out of this world.   We had possibly the best meal of our trip from the Latino food counter - it was mind blowing.

The signage throughout the house is adequate, but for $5 you get a much richer experience. We did the whole thing in 3 hours, and I mean the whole thing: house and gardens with audio tour, pressing every button. The house is a beautiful pastiche of early 20th-century robber-baron wealth: imported Venetian gates, French ceilings, etc. Pretty over the top. The gardens are lovely and a great interpretation of formal gardens with local South Florida plantings. We arrived at 11:30 and the place was pretty empty.

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,Haydee H,Great place for outdoor photos,Tip: Visit the house first if you're coming towards the end of the day.

We ate at a brew pub/NYC Village wanna be cool hipster place called Kush. I will review that separately. There is public parking available in open lots.  I would recommend only for over 12.

The years, moisture and lack of funding (I'm guessing) means it's a constant fight against Mother Nature to maintain this huge estate. The gardens are beautiful, lush, verdant. The house is fascinating to those of us who like to see how the rich lived in the day. The gift shop and cafe are temporarily housed in a tent which is less than optimal on many levels (who doesn't love a museum gift shop?) but I'm sure the finished product will be worth the wait.

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,684jennieh,Meh for the price,Although we enjoyed the view and the ornate furnishings we all felt it was overpriced for the experience. 3 stars reflects the expense and semi-clean bathrooms. Definitely not recommended for young kids. It does have beautiful gardens complete with stinky mangrove trees. Dripping with opulence and what must have been a desire to sink a lot of money into marble and ornamentation.,30,December 2019

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,Marshall B,"Third time, and still a charming place to visit!","This really is a place to take your vacationing visitors, and to enjoy again for yourself.    And, if you are a vacationing visitor,  you will not want to miss it and tell your friends back home about it.  The gardens are always interesting to walk through - the orchids in particular are amazingly varied and well-presented.  And, if  you happen to be a photographer,  you will not be displeased with either indoor or outdoor opportunities.  The collections of objects and furniture that you see indoors are quite impressive, much of which is based on foreign travels (and purchases).  I emphasize ""indoor"" in this review (I was also at Vizcaya in 2017) because it appears that photos now can be taken inside (but without flash) - in 2017 we were told no photos, which seemed a shame because there were (and are) some great opportunities inside.  Outdoors is still a venue for professional photographers, lining up couples as well as girls wearing their quinceanera dresses, but there is still room for your own photos.   Overall, a memorable experience, even after earlier memorable visits.",50,January 2019

Wynwood,Neighborhoods,Adventurer539381,Warning!!!  Car Broken into,"We drove into the Wynwood area and parked 30 yards away from the Bakan Restaurant in a paid public lot.  We were in the restaurant no more than 40 mins.  Our car was broken into and all our luggage taken!!   Called Miami PD, who said it would take at least an hour to get a police car there but we were welcome to drive to station to file report.  When we got to the station, others were there filling break in reports.  Seems like it happens a LOT in that area.     AVOID parking with any valuables in your car.  Not a safe area!!",10,April 2019
Wynwood,Neighborhoods,NewOrleansfirstgal,Very interesting art,We enjoyed the art.  It was very interesting and unique.  Each wall was different and I understand they change artist often.

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Specialty Museums,frand776,An historic gem,"My husband and I enjoyed touring this monument to a bygone era when wealthy industrialists built mansions as retreats from the cold and pressures of life in the north and Midwest. Not unlike the Isabel Stewart Gardner house in Boston, Vizcaya was designed as a one-of-a-kind “pleasure dome” and personal vision of its owner and is filled with art and gardens. There is no access for baby strollers so we had to keep close watch on the toddler in our party. It also seems to be a popular spot for weddings. Adjacent to the main building is a small snack bar that sells souvenirs. ",40,October 2019
